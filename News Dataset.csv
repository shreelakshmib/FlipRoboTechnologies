0,India’S Doubles Badminton Coach Tan Kim Her Resigns,"New Delhi: Malaysia’s Tan Kim Her has stepped down from his post as India’s doubles badminton coach, citing personal reasons.The 47-year-old, who was appointed as the national team’s doubles coach put down his papers, one-and-a-half years before his contract with the Badminton Association of India (BAI) was to end after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.“Yes, Tan Kim Her has resigned as doubles coach. He had put down his papers about a month back. He had some family problems, so he left India during the Senior Nationals,” BAI secretary (events) Omar Rashid told PTI.Tan Kim Her has earlier coached England, South Korea and Malaysia and there are speculations that he might have received some lucrative offer from another country.Asked about it, Rashid said: “No there is no truth in such speculations. There was no problem, he left purely due to personal reasons.”Under Tan Kim Her, India saw the rise of men’s doubles pair of Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy, who won the silver medal at the Commonwealth Games and also helped the country win the mixed team gold for the first time.The Indian duo won the Hyderabad Open Super 100 event and also reached the finals at Syed Modi Super 300 tournament and are currently ranked 20th in the world.The women’s pair of N Sikki Reddy and Ashwini Ponnappa also have done well under the Malaysian’s guidance, claiming the bronze medal at Gold Coast event.In early 2018, India’s singles coach Mulyo Handoyo of Indonesia also didn’t complete his contract and left abruptly citing personal reasons.BAI has recently roped in two Korean coaches Kim Ji Hyun and Park Tae Sang and the Indian team is awaiting their arrival.The onus of guiding the Indian doubles pairs will now rest on the two new doubles coaches Flandy Limpele and Namrih Suroto from Indonesia, who were also hired by BAI."
1,Markets Strategy: A Buy On Dips As Indices Look Overvalued,"It was an immensely volatile week for the markets in India. While Monday saw a spectacular rally, Tuesday and Wednesday saw immense bouts of volatility, thanks to surgical strikes launched by India and Pakistan’s reaction on Wednesday.However, most market participants have realized that war is not an option for either India or Pakistan and this led to buying support at lower levels. In the end, the Indian markets ended the week with gains of near 0.7 per cent.Going ahead, we are unlikely to see great gains for the markets, given the fact that we have elections slated in the next two months and the possibility of results being announced by mid-May. That is just 2 and half months from now.Nobody is sure of the election outcome. Until six months ago, it seemed almost certain that Narendra Modi would return to power for a second term. He might still, but, given the farmer distress and the outcome of election in the three states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhatisgarh which the Congress bagged, the final result is difficult to predict.A third key factor has also been the alliance of the BSP and the SP in Uttar Pradesh, which could pose further challenges for the BJP.In any case election outcomes are difficult to predict. Going by pure fundamentals, Indian markets remain overvalued. The trailing p/e of the Nifty is 26.32 times, as on Feb 28. This is rather steep and way beyond the historic average. As such it makes sense to stay on the sidelines.The one positive for the markets over the last week is the sustained buying from Foreign Portfolio Investors. Domestic institutions on the other hand have sold heavily. Most of these institutions may want to sit on cash ahead of the elections. Apart from this, there are reports that fund flows into domestic institutions maybe slowing down.On Thursday, domestic institutions sold a staggering Rs 5,240 crores of shares, while Foreign Portfolio Investors net bought Rs 3200 crores worth of shares in the cash market. It would be interesting to see, if FPIs continue to lend support to the market.If the markets had fallen steeply, it would have made sense to invest. However, with the Sensex at 36,000 points, it is not too attractive, though one must admit that several stocks at the moment continue to languish.Strategy to adoptIt is a good idea to buy the dips and then sell the rally. The markets are expected to trade in a range in the coming weeks. Volatility could largely be induced on account of global factors, given that the tensions along the border have now subsided. Sitting on a large amount of cash is now desirable, given that markets are overvalued.In fact, for high networth individuals sitting on cash can still yield good returns, given that many banks are now giving you interest rates. Stock market investors should now start bracing for tremendous volatility. Look for good quality stocks with a sound management. It is likely that these stocks may see limited downside risk in an environment of severe damage to stock prices."

5,SpaceX’S Crew Dragon Set To Be Launched With A Dummy Onboard,"Cape Canaveral (US), Mar 2: Eight years after the last manned US space flight, NASA and SpaceX are preparing to test a new space capsule for astronauts on Saturday — although for now the only occupant will be a dummy named Ripley. The new capsule will blast off on board a rocket built by SpaceX — the space company of billionaire Elon Musk — at 0249 (0749 GMT) on Saturday from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida.Its destination is the International Space Station, which it is scheduled to reach by Sunday, with a return to Earth next Friday. If the flight goes smoothly, NASA plans to put two astronauts on board SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule by the end of the year.The excitement was palpable Friday at Cape Canaveral, where a day earlier the rocket was wheeled out of its hangar and staged in a vertical position on the legendary launch pad where the Apollo Moon missions took off.“It’s been a long eight years,” said Bob Cabana, the Kennedy Space Center’s director and a former astronaut.“It’s exciting to see a crewed vehicle, the SpaceX Dragon, up there on a Falcon 9 on pad 39A,” said Cabana, who witnessed the last space shuttle flight return to Cape Canaveral on July 21, 2011.After the shuttle programme was shuttered in 2011 after a 30-year run, NASA began outsourcing the logistics of its space missions. It pays Russia to get its people up to the orbiting research facility at a cost of USD 82 million a head, for a round trip. In 2014, the US space agency awarded contracts to SpaceX and Boeing for them to take over this task.[Crew Dragon launch on March 2: 7 things to know about this crew-less test flight to ISS]But the programme has suffered delays as safety requirements are much more stringent for manned flights than for unmanned missions to deploy satellites. The sky over the launch site was clear Friday, with meteorologists saying there was an 80 per cent chance of conditions being favourable overnight.“When you are here, right, there is a pride in the country. It’s different,” said Mark Geyer, director of the Johnson Space Center, where US astronauts are based.“There is a pride in what the United States and its teams can accomplish.” Boeing also received a contract in 2014 to develop a space vessel, the Starliner. It will not be tested until April, in a mission similar to SpaceX’s. NASA did not want to rely on just one single vehicle, in case of accidents. Planning has been delayed by around three years, with the first manned SpaceX flight still pencilled in for July, though officials frequently refer to the end of 2019 as a more realistic deadline. Saturday’s flight aims to test the vessel’s reliability and safety in real-life conditions.The dummy that will ride in the capsule — which SpaceX’s Hans Koenigsmann prefers to call a “smartie” — has been nicknamed Ripley in honour of the character played by Sigourney Weaver in the “Alien” movies. It will be fitted with monitors to test the forces that future astronauts will be subjected to on take-off and when they return to the Earth’s atmosphere and then splash down in the Atlantic, slowed down by giant parachutes. Everything will have to function according to a strict plan: the separation of the capsule and the rocket, the 27 hours orbiting towards the space station and then docking with it.“We instrumented the crap out of that vehicle,” said Kathy Lueders, the manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew programme. “We are going to learn a ton from this mission.” For SpaceX, which Musk founded in 2002, sending an astronaut into orbit would be a culmination of years of hard work and high-risk investment.“Every mission is important, but this is even more important,” said Koenigsmann, the firm’s vice-president for build and flight reliability. “Early on, our goal was human spaceflight,” he said.“Human spaceflight is a core value of business of SpaceX.” In less than a decade, SpaceX has become a key partner for NASA, in addition to dominating the market for private satellite launches. Its Falcon 9 rockets have resupplied the space station 15 times in seven years, even though one of them blew up in 2015."
6,"UNSC Blacklists Osama Bin Laden’S Son, Seen As Successor Of Al-Zawahiri","United Nations, Mar 02: The UN Security Council has designated Hamza bin Laden, the son of slain Al Qaida chief Osama bin Laden, under its sanctions list, subjecting him to a travel ban, assets freeze and an arms embargo as it described him as being seen as the “most probable successor” of the group’s current leader Aiman al-Zawahiri.The UN Security Council’s 1267 ISIS and Al Qaida Sanctions Committee listed 29-year old Hamza bin Laden on Thursday, the day the US announced a reward of up to one million dollars for information about him.

Just hours before the UNSC Sanctions Committee designated Hamza bin Laden, the US State Department’s Rewards for Justice Program announced a reward for up to USD 1 million for information leading to his identification or location in any country, saying he is emerging as a leader in the Al Qaida franchise.“Since at least August 2015, he has released audio and video messages on the Internet calling on his followers to launch attacks against the United States and its Western allies, and he has threatened attacks against the United States in revenge for the May 2011 killing of his father by U.S. service members,” the State Department said.In January 2017, the State Department had listed Hamza bin Laden as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, freezing all of his assets based in the United States or in the possession or control of US persons."
7,US Slaps New Sanctions On Venezuela Regime,"Washington, Mar 2: The United States and Russia clashed Friday over how to assist crisis-wracked Venezuela, with Moscow pledging new relief channeled through President Nicolas Maduro and Washington slapping sanctions over the blocking of US aid it tried to push through the border.A day after Russia and China vetoed a US and European resolution at the UN Security Council that called for unimpeded aid deliveries, Washington said it was targeting six Venezuelan military officers for stopping last weekend’s US-led convoy. Four people were killed in the melee as Maduro’s forces prevented the 178 metric tonnes of rice, beans and other food from crossing into the country from Colombia. The leftist strongman says the aid is a pretext for a US-led invasion.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_2_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 280px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 1001px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_2_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 280px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 1001px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden;""><iframe id=""aswift_2"" name=""aswift_2"" style=""left: 0px; position: absolute; top: 0px; border: 0px; width: 1001px; height: 280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""1001"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=3262248876&amp;adf=3368211027&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.3~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615631534&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fus-slaps-new-sanctions-on-venezuela-regime%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615631534499&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=1209&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D787eaae6addf9355-22091e09e0c60009%3AT%3D1615631456%3ART%3D1615631456%3AS%3DALNI_MatMmJ5NOCNOrQB_PztuLDvOlBFCA&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1001x280&amp;nras=3&amp;correlator=8588213883978&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=757171751.1615631453&amp;ga_sid=1615631534&amp;ga_hid=873150510&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=10&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1464&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=21068084%2C21069711&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=552766078131535&amp;pem=505&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=3&amp;uci=a!3&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=weFY9oq35t&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=10"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!3"" data-google-query-id=""CKySwL6Ire8CFTIurQYdL6sOlg"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
“We are sanctioning members of Maduro’s security forces in response to the reprehensible violence, tragic deaths and unconscionable torching of food and medicine destined for sick and starving Venezuelans,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.[Venezuela political crisis: China, Russia veto US resolution in the UN]The six include Major General Richard Jesus Lopez Vargas, the commander of the Venezuelan National Guard. The sanctions freeze any assets in the United States and penalize US financial dealings with the officials. The United States also revoked the visas of 49 Venezuelan officials and their family members, the State Department said.Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, whom Washington has recognized as interim president, had hoped to triumph in bringing in the stockpiles of food, which the United States coordinated with Colombia and Brazil. Guaido has said 300,000 people could die without an influx of aid into Venezuela. The United Nations says 2.7 million Venezuelans have fled since 2015 as the socialist economy crumbles, with basic supplies out of reach to the masses. More than 50 countries recognize Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful president — but Maduro enjoys strong support from Russia, which is eager to challenge US interventionism, as well as China, which is concerned over the fate of billions of dollars Beijing has lent to Caracas.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 280px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 1001px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 280px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 1001px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left: 0px; position: absolute; top: 0px; border: 0px; width: 1001px; height: 280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""1001"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=3262248876&amp;adf=4128069035&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.11~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615631534&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fus-slaps-new-sanctions-on-venezuela-regime%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615631534499&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=1209&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D787eaae6addf9355-22091e09e0c60009%3AT%3D1615631456%3ART%3D1615631456%3AS%3DALNI_MatMmJ5NOCNOrQB_PztuLDvOlBFCA&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1001x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=8588213883978&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=757171751.1615631453&amp;ga_sid=1615631534&amp;ga_hid=873150510&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=10&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2260&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=21068084%2C21069711&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=552766078131535&amp;pem=505&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=pcqNvrfKXi&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=15"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CKzwwL6Ire8CFewYrQYdYUkC9A"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, receiving Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez in Moscow, said Russia was stepping up shipments of wheat and was considering sending more medical supplies after shipping 7.5 tonnes.“We are very closely cooperating and coordinating all our steps in the international arena,” Lavrov said. “This has acquired special significance now that Venezuela is facing a frontal attack and unabashed interference in its domestic affairs,” he said.Elliott Abrams, the US special representative on the crisis, charged that Maduro’s forces would turn Russian aid into a “political weapon” by providing it only to supporters.“Obviously we are in favor of giving humanitarian assistance to Venezuela; we are not in favor of giving it to this corrupt regime,” Abrams told reporters in Washington. Lavrov voiced hope that international pressure would “cool hotheads in Washington” who he said are seeking military intervention in Venezuela.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
He alleged that the United States was planning to buy small arms, mortar launchers and shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles from an “Eastern European country” and station them “close to Venezuela.” President Donald Trump has not ruled out military intervention in Venezuela, although even close US allies have said they would not support the use of force.Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who has worked closely with Trump to seek Maduro’s ouster, appeared this week to suggest a violent climax as he posted on Twitter two pictures of Libyan dictator Moamer Kadhafi — one relaxed and smiling while in power, the other bloodied as he was lynched in an uprising. Defying a travel ban by Maduro, Guaido went first to Colombia to try to bring in the aid and to meet with visiting US Vice President Mike Pence.The 35-year-old political newcomer continued on to Brazil, where he met the new right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, and on Friday traveled to Paraguay and Argentina. Guaido has said he will return home “at the latest on Monday” despite threats to arrest him."

The JeM is a history-sheeter directly culpable of many terror-related crimes directed against India since 2001. Millennial India and Indians, with a government that places a premium on machismo , had decided that armed revenge was the best strategic response. Armed revenge that would show the world, and Pakistan, the grit and muscle of a new, avenging India. Armed revenge especially because Pakistan has refused through the years to act against the JeM whose leader Maulana Masood Azhar enjoys the unbroken nurture and protection of state patronage in Pakistan.In a classically-ordained textbook scenario, raining revenge on Pakistan should not be difficult. The country is no match for India in terms of size, economic muscle, democratic strength, political stability and global stature. But its power structure, dominated by a powerful military, which sees itself as the guardian of the ‘idea’ of Pakistan, survives on the passionate urge to resist India even if it may mean the destruction of their own country. Pakistan, therefore, is by this definition no mean or ordinary enemy of India. It is India’s incubus, our nightmare. It is the neighbourhood stalker, lurking everywhere.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=1196313299&amp;adf=4103086588&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.7~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615631552&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Funlike-donald-trumps-us-and-mexico-we-cant-build-a-wall-between-india-and-pakistan%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615631552282&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=1259&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D787eaae6addf9355-22091e09e0c60009%3AT%3D1615631456%3ART%3D1615631456%3AS%3DALNI_MatMmJ5NOCNOrQB_PztuLDvOlBFCA&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1001x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=5135835759569&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=757171751.1615631453&amp;ga_sid=1615631551&amp;ga_hid=1837829090&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=12&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2093&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=42530672%2C21068084%2C31060351&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=3874978177468515&amp;pem=505&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=r2wuD0g6Bq&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=19"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CMCBg8eIre8CFZsIBgAdCV4CSQ"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
The problem of India-Pakistan tensions over Kashmir is the living embodiment of 70 years of bitterness and enmity between the two countries. The wound has festered and only got worse as it has turned Kashmir into a crucible of death, destruction, alienation, militancy and civilian unrest. The reality is that India has a problem in Kashmir, its catalyst being the dispute with Pakistan, and its oxygen being both the militancy, which is fuelled from across the Line of Control, and a strong sense of victimhood among many Kashmiris in this Muslim-majority state that the political class both at the state and national level has ill-served and short-changed them.The Indian Army and paramilitary forces, who are present in large numbers to ensure the security of this sensitive border state, are often the target of the disaffection and anger of sections of the population, and increasingly many young Kashmiris. Militancy, oxygenated from within but mainly from Pakistan, moves in then to easily target military and paramilitary personnel in an atmosphere of popular resentment, radicalisation and fundamentalist, Islamic indoctrination. Pulwama was a manifestation.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_4"" name=""aswift_4"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=1196313299&amp;adf=3502177898&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.11~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615631553&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Funlike-donald-trumps-us-and-mexico-we-cant-build-a-wall-between-india-and-pakistan%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615631552260&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=1237&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D787eaae6addf9355-22091e09e0c60009%3AT%3D1615631456%3ART%3D1615631456%3AS%3DALNI_MatMmJ5NOCNOrQB_PztuLDvOlBFCA&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1001x280%2C699x280%2C699x280%2C236x240%2C1017x613&amp;nras=7&amp;correlator=5135835759569&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=757171751.1615631453&amp;ga_sid=1615631551&amp;ga_hid=1837829090&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=12&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2239&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=42530672%2C21068084%2C31060351&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=3874978177468515&amp;pem=505&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=5&amp;uci=a!5&amp;btvi=5&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=wmnE0G2rI3&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=921"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!5"" data-google-query-id=""CP-Hu8eIre8CFYjN1QodEYsKnQ"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
On 26 February, Indian Air Force (IAF) planes struck at a terror camp deep inside Pakistan at Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, very close to the cantonment of Abbottabad where Osama bin Laden was taken out by the US forces in May 2011. The Indian planes flew unhindered into Pakistani airspace, bombed their target, and returned home. The Indian side claimed that they had eliminated the JeM terror camp at Balakot and there were reports that the strikes had killed more than 300 JeM terrorists. The Pakistanis have denied this. The fog of conflict camouflages everything.Like in May 2011, the Pakistani establishment was left red-faced at the perceived lack of ability to intercept the Indians. Unlike with the United States, an India-obsessed Pakistan scrambled to hit back. The scale of escalation went up with the dog-fight across the Line of Control in Kashmir between the Indian and Pakistani Air Force planes the next day.Both countries claimed they shot down a plane. An IAF pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, was captured by the Pakistanis and visuals of him were paraded on social media in what was interpreted as a contravention of the Geneva Conventions, after he ejected from his aircraft on the Pakistani side of the Line of Control. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan subsequently announced that he did not want a miscalculation-replete war with India and that his government would return the captured IAF officer to India. It is believed that Pakistan came under pressure from the governments of the United States, and its close friends, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, to be conciliatory towards India and not escalate tensions further.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
Many in India also saw this move by PM Imran Khan as Pakistan having ‘buckled’ and ‘blinked’ to the advantage of India, which had ‘succeeded’ in what was termed as a ‘non-military, pre-emptive’ action taken against the JeM, inside Pakistan, in order to safeguard India’s national security.There is no doubt that the world community, in large measure, sees India as the victim of terrorism directed against it from groups within Pakistan. There is also recognition of the fact that this terrorism is used by Pakistan as an instrument of state policy against India.But India’s efforts to see the Pakistani terror groups internationally proscribed across-the-board have yet to see complete fruition. The listing of Masood Azhar on the UN Security Council sanctions list has been held up because China, a close ally of Pakistan, has sacrificed responsible international conduct and action against terrorism at the altar of its so-called obligations to Pakistan. This matter also casts a lengthening shadow on India’s relations with China, a relationship that India has sought long and hard to normalise and carry forward in a spirit of pragmatism, cooperation and peaceful dialogue.While there may be takers for Pakistan PM’s seemingly conciliatory offer of dialogue with India and readiness to return the IAF pilot, Pakistan’s global credentials are tainted by its identification with terrorism as an instrument of state policy. Its friendship with the United States has long vanished with the Americans having understood the damage done by Pakistan’s Afghanistan policy to American interests and American lives in that country.The Narendra Modi government’s outreach in building closer, substantive bilateral relations with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates has yielded dividends. The quotient of mutual trust in these relations is significantly higher today than ever before. The invitation to the Indian foreign minister to be the guest-of-honour at the conference of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) is also a measure of this. Indian presence at the OIC is being marked after an interregnum of half-a-century. Pakistan played the spoiler in ensuring India was kept out all these years. This time, it has boycotted the conference in a sulk about India being invited to the gathering. This is a diplomatic setback for Pakistan and clearly a substantial diplomatic victory for India.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_6_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_6_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
All this, however, cannot mitigate the very real problems in India-Pakistan relations and the tangled web of problems in Kashmir. While war between two nuclear-armed nations lurks at the bottom of this abyss, it is in the interest of both countries to draw back from that brink and climb down the escalation ladder in a conflict. A war of nuclear proportions is not a video-game or a ball to be casually bounced back and forth in television studios and on Twitter. It is in the interest of both the countries to be rational and mature in their handling of bilateral relations. Otherwise, the threat of mutual destruction is no longer a theoretical construct.India is on the right track as it seeks to augment diplomatic capital for its cause in the fight against terrorism. Military pressure will not bring Pakistan to its knees. A diplomatic global coalition that partners with India to seek an end to Pakistan’s sponsorship of terror has to grow, develop and strengthen. International organisations like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) are particularly important theatres of action where the struggle to isolate Pakistan and impose sanctions for its support to terrorism and violation of laws on global financial good conduct must intensify. India has to be a much more active player in the region in convening this coalition against terror.Neutralisation of Pakistani capacity to cause mischief and damage has to also entail a more active role in engaging Afghanistan and, if needed, the India-ostracised Taliban (engaging the Taliban does not mean supporting their ideology but just building channels of two-way communication) as well as the regional players involved, as the US prepares to disengage from that country. Support for terrorism must become a globally sanctioned activity as much as the proliferation of nuclear weapons is.Simultaneously, our own domestic capacity to deal with terror threats and prevent further terror attacks on the homeland must be improved significantly. Loopholes and intelligence lapses can be lethal.A post-election government that comes to power later this year in India must also turn its close attention to how relations with Pakistan must be transacted. Unlike President Donald Trump with Mexico, we cannot build a high wall between Pakistan and us. As much as we improve our security preparedness and the military wherewithal to defend our democracy and our people, we must have a diplomatic strategy that engages the enemy face-to-face, oxymoronic as that may sound.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_7_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_7_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
The point is that while India can certainly win the support of the global community of nations on its struggle against terrorism, even a partially-blown military conflict is another matter. We cannot expect our foreign friends and partners to rally around us in such a scenario however much we may believe that we fight a good fight for all that is right. The terrain of conflict is a lonely, and barren place. Soldiers and ordinary citizens pay the cost. Our leaders across dividing lines and frontiers must realise that they hold these lives in trust. It is an awesome responsibility.The author is a former foreign secretary, and was India’s ambassador to the US.

10,Wg Cdr Abhinandan Varthaman Made To Record Video ‘Praising Pak Army’ Before Being Released,"The handing over of IAF pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman to India at Wagah was delayed on Friday as he was made to record a video statement by Pakistani authorities before he was allowed to cross the border, according to sources.It was not clear whether he was made to record the video under duress.At 8.30 pm (local) time, the Pakistan government released the pilot’s video message to the local media in which he said as to how he was captured.“Recording of his video message caused delay in his handing over,” a source said.In the video message, Varthaman said he entered Pakistan’s space to “find a target” but his aircraft was shot down.“The army personnel saved me from the mob. The Pakistani army is very professional and I am impressed by it,” he said, while criticising the Indian media.India has maintained that Varthaman’s plane was downed when IAF planes foiled an attempt by Pakistan Air Force to target Indian military installations in Jammu and Kashmir on February 27, a day after New Delhi had conducted counter-terror operations in Pakistan’s Balakot.He ejected out of the aircraft but drifted to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir where he was detained by the Pakistan Army.Although there has been no official word as to what time he was brought to the Wagah border on Friday, but sources say he reached Lahore after 4 pm.The Pakistani media reported that “his papers were being checked at the Wagah immigration” that was why he was not being “immediately” handed over to the Indian authorities.Varthaman was handed over at around 9.20 pm.Away from public eyes, Wg Cdr Abhinandan Varthaman returns to IndiaThe 35-year-old Wing Commander spent nearly 60 hours in Pakistani captivity after his MiG-21 Bison fighter jet was hit by Pakistan Air Force jets near the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday.Pakistan had earlier on Wednesday circulated videos of the captured pilot being interrogated blindfolded while being tied up with a bloodied face.The pilot was seen identifying himself as Wing Commander Abhinandan of the IAF. He gives out his service number and refuses to answer further questions.The videos were however, taken off as India strongly objected to Pakistan’s “vulgar display of an injured personnel of the Indian Air Force” in violation of all norms of the International Humanitarian Law and the Geneva Convention.Following this, another clip was circulated where the IAF pilot was seen sipping tea saying that he was being “looked after well” by the officers of the Pakistan army.After immense pressure from India and other nations, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday announced that the pilot would be released as a “gesture of goodwill”."
11,President Issues Order Extending Quota For EWS In J&K,"New Delhi, Mar 02: President Ram Nath Kovind issued an order extending the benefits of reservation to economically backward sections in Jammu and Kashmir on Friday night.A notification in this regard was issued after a meeting of the Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, took a decision on Thursday to issue the order, a Home Ministry official said.With this, the 10 per cent reservation for economically weaker sections has been made applicable in Jammu and Kashmir also.Air strike at Balakot hit four JeM buildings, SAR evidence suggestsThis would pave the way for reserving state government jobs to the youth of Jammu and Kashmir who are from economically weaker sections belonging to any religion or caste, the official said.Ten per cent reservation to economically weaker sections was introduced in the rest of the country through the 103rd Constitutional Amendment in January 2019.The central government’s move came as Jammu and Kashmir is currently under the President’s Rule."
12,Trump Asks China To Remove Agricultural Tariffs On US,"Washington, March 2 (IANS) US President Donald Trump has asked China to remove all of its tariffs on American agricultural products, pointing to his decision to delay a second round of tariffs and to improving trade relations with Beijing.”I have asked China to immediately remove all tariffs on our agricultural products (including beef, pork, etc.) based on the fact that we are moving along nicely with trade discussions,” he tweeted on Friday, adding: “And I did not increase their second traunch of tariffs to 25 per cent on March 1. This is very important for our great farmers – and me.”Trump had announced the decision to delay the tariffs, as well as a planned summit to wrap up the trade agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, earlier this week, reports CNN. The tariffs had been set to go into effect on Friday if no trade deal were reached.China is the US’ second largest agricultural market, according to data from the Office of the US Trade Representative. US agricultural exports to China hit $20 billion in 2017, with soybeans, the largest sole export, accounting for $12 billion.On February 24, Trump had lauded “substantial progress” in the talks covering “important structural issues including intellectual property protection, technology transfer, agriculture, services, currency, and many other issues”.Trump’s request on Friday came following his decision to walk away from negotiations with North Korea at a summit in Vietnam on Thursday, alleging that leader Kim Jong-un had insisted on full sanctions relief in exchange for partial denuclearization in an unacceptable offer."
13,JeM Hasn’T Claimed Responsibility For Pulwama Attack: Pak Minister,"A day after he said that Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar is in Pakistan and is unwell, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi pointed out that the terror outfit has not claimed responsibility for the Pulwama attack and there’s confusion if it was behind the strike.Wen asked about JeM claiming the Pulwama attack, Qureshi told the BBC in an interview on Friday, 1 March: “We are not sure of that.”Shah Mahmood Qureshi, as told to the BBC”The confusion is that the leadership, when contacted, they said no. (The leadership has been contacted) by people over here. They deny that. they claimed no responsibility. there’s confusion. There are conflicting reports on it.”‘Won’t Allow Pakistan to Be Used for Terrorist Activity’Qureshi asserted that his country’s policy on terrorism is very clear, in that they would “not allow Pakistani soil to be used by any group or any organisation for terrorist activity against anyone, including India.”While attempting to avoid direct references to JeM Chief Masood Azhar, Qureshi called for India to share evidence with Pakistan. “Then, we can articulate the case in court, and we can justify action against that individual or that organisation to the people of Pakistan,” he added, as he reiterated that his country wants a de-escalation of tensions.Shah Mahmood Qureshi, as told to the BBC”We are studying the dossier (given by India on Pulwama attack). If India wants to initiate a dialogue based on this dossier, we are willing to engage with them.”He also questioned the air strikes across the LoC by the Indian Air Force on 26 February.“India claimed they hit 3 terror camps. Where are they? They claimed that they killed 350 terrorists. Where are the bodies,” the Pakistan minister asked.On Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Qureshi said that India has taken an “extreme position.”“The pendulum has gone so far, coming back would be challenging for him (PM Modi),” Qureshi added."
14,"PM Modi Has Taken ‘Narasimha Avtar’, Says O Panneerselvam On Airstrikes","Kanyakumari: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken the “Narasimha avatar”, Tamil Nadu Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam said on Friday, likening him to the incarnation of Lord Vishnu as he and chief minister K Palaniswami praised the Prime Minister for “decimating” terrorists in Pakistan in air strikes.Panneerselvam said PM Modi did not buckle under the threat of terrorism and instead had taken the “Narasimha avatar”, a reference to Hindu faith in which Lord Vishnu takes the ferocious incarnation in the form of human body with the head of a lion to destroy demon king Hiranyakasibu.“Without buckling under the threat of terrorism of the neighbouring country, PM Modi took Narasimha avatar and decimated hundreds of terrorists which the world lauded,” he said at a function in Kanyakumari where the Prime Minister dedicated to the nation various highway and railway projects in Tamil Nadu.He was referring to the February 26 predawn air strikes on a terror camp in Pakistan days after the killing of 40 CRPF jawans by a Jaish-e-Mohammed suicide bomber in Jammu and Kashmir.The Deputy Chief Minister praised PM Modi for his “strong and steadfast leadership,” in battling external threats in a bold and decisive manner without a wink of sleep.Such resolute steps were a warning signal to countries that supported terrorism, he noted.Speaking after his deputy, Palaniswami hailed PM Modi for bold and decisive measures to root out terrorism.“On behalf of the people of Tamil Nadu, I thank the Prime Minister for the bold and decisive measures to root out terrorism, which is threatening the world and the successful air strike to decimate the terrorist camps.”“Entire country and Tamil Nadu stands behind you,” the Chief Minister said referring to PM Modi.This is the first time, the top two leaders of the AIADMK joined the Prime Minister in an official event after their party inked a poll pact with BJP on Feb 19 for the coming Lok Sabha elections.The Chief Minister also thanked PM Modi for his effective diplomatic steps to bring back Wing Commander Abhinandan safely to India.Palaniswami requested PM Modi to establish a naval station at Kanyakumari for ensuring the safety and security of fishermen.Today’s event was a “beginning to the Himalayan victory,” he said in an apparent reference that the AIADMK-BJP combine will emerge victorious in Tamil Nadu in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the Deputy Chief Minister said."

18,Tata Motors Denies Reports Of JLR Unit Sake Sale,"Two media reports said the company was considering options including a minority stake sale in the JLR unit or finding a venture partner.Tata Motors Ltd on Friday denied media reports that it was exploring options for its ailing luxury car unit Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc.Two media reports said the company was considering options including a minority stake sale in the JLR unit or finding a venture partner that would jointly develop vehicles and lower costs.The reports of a potential stake sale drove Tata Motors shares up as much as 3.7 per cent to 184 rupees. The stock pared some of the gains and ended up 1.6 per cent.“There is no truth to the rumours that Tata Motors is looking to divest its stake in JLR,” a Tata Motors spokesperson told Reuters.Tata Motors posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss in Indian corporate history of about USD 4 billion last month, hurt by slumping China sales.The company also warned the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) unit, which brings in most of its revenue, would swing to an operating loss in the year to March versus an earlier projection for breakeven, given weak sales at the luxury British carmaker.The company may prefer to keep control of JLR, and rather seek fresh equity from investors, BloombergQuint said citing a Bloomberg report.The discussions are at an early stage and Tata Motors has held preliminary talks with potential advisers, ET Now reported."
19,Fxtec Pro1 Set To Recreate The Magic Of Sliding Qwerty Phones,"Nokia bought the trend of sliding qwerty keyboard design of phones with its Nokia 9000 Communicator back in 1996. Later the company also introduced similar models with improved design. The trend of the sliding phone was also adopted by Samsung in its Corby series. Later the trend was taken over by the complete touch-screen smartphones, and smartphone makers started ditching every possible physical button from the mobile phones.But it seems that the retro design of the siliding keyboard smartphone is once again coming back in the trend. UK based smartphone maker Fxtec thinks that the market for sliding smartphone still has some room in the mobile phone industry. The company has come up with a new sliding smartphone with qwerty keypad design called Fxtec Pro1.Fxtec took the wraps off its latest smartphone in the MWC 2019, which offers the ‘Key’ element which is quite missing the all the next generation smartphones. All the smartphone makers are busy reducing the bezels and physical keys from the latest flagships. Meanwhile, the London-based company has once again introduced the qwerty-keyboard designed phone.There are many keyboard fans who prefer typing on the physical keys rather than typing on a touch screen keyboard. The Fxtec Pro1 offers a slide-out 5.99-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 2160 x 1080 Pixels. The smartphone offers a sliding angle of 155 degrees which delivers better user experience.Under the hood, the smartphone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, clubbed with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, you can also expand the storage up to 2TB via microSD card. On the software part, the Fxtec Pro1 arrives with latest Android 9.0 Pie out-of-the-box.As far as cameras are concerned, the Fxtec Pro1 features a dual camera setup with the combination of 12-megapixel + 5-megapixel camera sensors along with an LED flash. At the front, the phone houses an 8-megapixel camera for selfies and video calls.Rather than following the trend of an in-display fingerprint scanner. The company has embedded the sensor on the side-mounted button. The Fxtec Pro1 is fuelled by a 3,200mAh non-removable battery, and the company claims that it is capable of delivering up to 10 hours of talk time and 20 hours of standby in a single charge.OpinionWhile looking at the design of the Fxtec Pro1 I must say that it resembles a lot like Nokia E7, which have the same upwards fold with similar sliding angle along with a touch screen display. However, the Fxtec Pro1 is altogether a different phone and comes with the latest version of Android. Design wise it looks very attractive and also features dedicated camera shutter which use to be there in the Nokia phone back in the ’90s.This smartphone will be a dream come true for users who were waiting for an Android smartphone with a sliding retro look. I liked the phone because of its design and qwerty keyboard which comes with a lot of shortcuts and navigation features. The fully-functioning keyboard comes with dedicated keys like Ctrl, Shift, Caps, Esc, Del, and a number row on the top.The Fxtec Pro1 is currently available for purchase in the US for $649, the UK for £649, and across Europe for €649. Let’s see when the company will launch the phone in India."
20,"We Need To Fight Terrorist, Not Each Other Says Upen Patel","Actor Upen Patel says it is great to see both the countries saying no to war because we need to fight terrorist, not each other.Multi-lingual actor Upen Patel raises some valid points in his recent social media post. The actor shared a series of video, where he is seen saying that India-Pakistan doesn’t need to fight each other but combine forces to fight terrorist.“It is great to see tweets from both the sides, Pakistan and India, saying No To War, and that is wonderful because this is not about war, this is about a fight against terrorists, who are killing innocent people,” says Upen Patel. In the wake of Pulwama Terror Attack, Indian Air Force and Pakistani Air Force have been engaging in aerial battle, and one Indian Air Force Pilot has been captured behind the enemy lines. The Pakistan Army released a video that shows a blindfolded man, identifying himself as a Wing Commander-rank IAF officer and his service number.Talking about the Pilot, Upen said, “Just saw the video of Indian pilot, who is being held in Pakistan, what a brave man. He is doing what he was ordered, representing his country. I am glad Pakistani authorities have treated him well” Further adding, “It is important to remember that this isn’t about two nations, nor it is about religion, it is about coming together as nations and fighting terrorists, fight terror and those who cause terror,” said Upen in his video post.The Indian Government has strongly objected to Islamabad putting out photographs and videos of the pilot who was missing in action after he engaged with Pakistani jets that violated Indian airspace on Wednesday morning.After appearing in five back-to-back Tamil films in the last two years and working with top directors such as Shankar, AR Murugadoss and R Kannan, actor Upen will soon make his debut in the Telugu film industry.The mega project, which has already begun shooting in Jaisalmer, is being directed by Thiru.Actor Upen will be seen playing the main antagonist in the film, which also stars Gopichand. The action spy thriller will reportedly be shot at a massive budget. "
21,Taapsee Pannu Backs Ali Zafar For Supporting His Country And Says There’S Nothing Wrong With That,"In the wake of recent events, all the artistes from Pakistan have been banned in India and vice versa. The artistes are being mercilessly trolled for voicing their opinions and Pakistani singer, Ali Zafar, is one of them. Being a Pakistani, Ali Zafar was obviously supporting the PM of Pakistan, Imran Khan. He took to Twitter to appreciate his speech and tweeted, “What a speech!” While he was just being a dutiful citizen of his country, the netizens trolled him and called him out for supporting Pakistan.Taapsee Pannu who is now gearing up for her upcoming film Badla, came out in support of Ali Zafar. When enquired about her views on him being trolled, she aptly said that he shouldn’t be expected to support India. Being a Pakistani, if he is supporting his country, what’s wrong with that? Taap spoke about the ban on the artistes and said that it is not like he is not getting work there, he is and will work in Pakistan. He would’ve been trolled had he not supported his country just like she got trolled by Pakistanis for supporting India.We are in total agreement with Taapsee. The artistes get trolled no matter what they do so it is better that they support their respective countries. As Taapsee said, it is stupid to expect him to support a country he is not a part of. On the work front, Taapsee’s film Badla will hit the screens on 8th March."
22,Luka Chuppi Review: Kartik Aaryan And Kriti Sanon Starrer Is A Fun Ride,"Kartik Aaryan and Kriti Sanon starrer Luka Chuppi has been released in cinemas. The story of the film revolves around a couple who decides to go for a live-in relationship before tying the knot. Here is Luka Chuppi review which might help you to watch it.Set in Mathura, the movie revolves around Guddu (Kartik Aaryan), a reporter of a news channel and Rashmi (Kriti Sanon), an aspiring journalist, who gets the job in the same news channel. Rashmi’s father (Vinay Pathak) is a politician who is against the live-in culture and blatantly oppose it publicly. The duo fall in love with each other. Guddu, in a heated argument, challenges his elder brother that he will marry first and proposes Rashmi. Rashmi decides to live-in with Guddu in order to know him better. There start the difficulties and how they keep lying about their relationship status till the end, is what the rest of the story is all about.Kartik Aaryan’s performance will keep you glued to the screen while Kriti Sanon too brought the charm. Aparshakti Khurana is impressive as Abbas, Guddu’s best friend and cameraperson. While, others have done justice to their roles.After Total Dhamaal, Luka Chuppi and Arjun Patiala won’t release in PakistanThe film’s music is okay. All the songs are recreated in the film.The film’s direction is good. Laxman Utekar does a more than efficient job overseeing the cinematography of the film, but the script of the film could be even better. The small town humour is also spot on and some of the gags manage to get you rolling on the floor laughing.‘Luka Chuppi’ is a fun ride, you can watch it once."

24,Sonchiriya Review: It Is Much More Than A Slick Dacoit Drama,"Some of our actors are so inured in brilliance we’ve ceased to notice their power . Ranveer Shorey is one of them. He just blends into the bleeding colours of brilliancy in this exceptional film set in the dark desperate world of dacoits in the confounding ravines of the Chambal valley.By singling out Shorey’s brilliance I don’t mean to undermine the other performers, most of whom are so skillfully effective, they seem to have been born in the hungering shadows of their ever-renewable excellence.But then the point here is not the brilliance. It is how the rites of accomplished filmmaking are applied to a solid narration that are on your mark and all set to go even before we are fully able to grasp the wide spectrum of characters on the run. Dammit, they are all fugitives, even the vicious vendetta-seeking cop played with a iron ironic meanness by Ashutosh Rana who is so bloodthirsty his venom fills the Chambal valley with echoes of exasperating nemesis.But Rana doesn’t play the most vicious character in Sonchiriya. A young boy with a big gun who plays Bhumi Pednekar’s violent son is perhaps the most bloodthirsty son under the sun. He wants his mother dead, at any cost even when his father pl the talented Jatin Sarna (who is not really his father) wants to forgive his wife for being who she is. A rebel.Phoolan Devi who appears towards the end of this long unpunctuated treatise on torment trauma subjugation and atonement, would laugh dryly at the thought of a woman rebel. Are women allowed the luxury of rebelling against patriarchal tyranny without losing everything? Phoolan and our film’s heroine Indumati Tomar, played magnificently by Bhumi Pednekar, hit it off at a time when their life is at the brink of extinction.The screen-Phoolan has the best lines I’ve heard on patriarchy in cinema. “The caste system is for men to fight and gain supremacy. We women all belong to one caste.” Phoolan makes Indumati an offer to join her gang. Does Indumati take up that job offer after the movie ends? Is there any other option for the oppressed than outlawry? Sonchiriya is the most anguished plea against injustice and oppression since Bimal Roy’s Sujata. The deep silences in Abhishek Chaubey’s clenched narrative reminded me of Roy’s film about a Harijan girl (Nutan) looking for an identity.We don’t have Harijans anymore as targets of exploitation. We have Dalits, and gosh, so many variations of oppressed communities in this film, I began to wonder if there is any section of the society that is not traumatized and brutalized! Chaubey uses eerie silences in the stunning Chambal landscape to punctuate a sense of excruciating oppression.I wish Vishal Bhardwaj’s background score was better able to capture the vile viscosity of the environment, thick with suggestions and manifestation of violence. In this world of apocalyptic despair, Sushant Singh Rajput’s Lakhna decides to rid his guilty conscience of its inexorable burden by helping a woman to protect and heal a brutally raped girl-child .I wish the relationship between Lakhna and the ravaged girl was given more space to grow. But then where is the room for relationships to breathe when men are constantly on the run, and not just from the law? I wished for Lakhna and Indumati’s bonding over the child to end in some semblance of joy.But wishes cannot be horses. Not in a dacoit drama without a single horse in sight. In fact there is a joke in the film about how Hindi films show dacoits galloping away when in fact there are no horses in the Chambal Valley.There are no heroes either. Only victims posing manfully with guns that kill not just human beings. But also hope.I came away with two heroes in Sonchiriya. The little brutalised girl from whom the film gets its title, whose devastated eyes still secrete a smile after all she has gone through. Some hope!And cinematographer Anuj Rakesh Dhawan whose lenses render bleakness into myriad shades of life lived on the edge. Raw gritty and compelling, Sonchiriya conveys a clandestine narrative style that never impinges on the violent disarray of the characters’ brutal unpredictable lives."

26,Youngsters Sledge Veteran Stars Ahead Of IPL 2019,"Ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2019, a couple of youngsters of the Indian squad fired warnings at its most decorated players — Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni.Pacer Jasprit Bumrah and wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant sledged Dhoni and Kohli ahead of the upcoming edition of the cash-rich T20 tournament.

A final call is expected to be taken by the evening.In case Dhoni is unavailable, then Rishabh Pant is expected to don the big gloves. That is the most likely option in case Dhoni fails to get fit in time.If the team management is keen on checking all the fringe batting options, then KL Rahul and Ambati Rayudu could both play in the XI with Rahul keeping.India are aiming to bounce back in the five-match ODI series after losing both the T20Is."

Now between the two teams, the three-match T-20 series will be played in Guwahati, with the first match on March 4.Chasing 205 for 8 wickets, England were struggling at 49 for five, after which all-rounder Danny Voight (56 runs in 82 balls), captain Heather Knight (47 off 63 balls) and Georgia Elvis (unbeaten 33 runs in 53 balls) played two crucial partnerships and played a key role in the team’s victory.England scored 208 runs in eight overs in 48.5 overs, raising two important points, because this series of three matches is part of the ICC Women’s Championship.

Slowing government spending in the last quarter due to fiscal constraints and contracting rural demand can hurt it further. With inflation below the comfort level, RBI should cut interest rates again to encourage investment and growth.Third-party intervention has trumped India-Pakistan bilateralismAfter two decades — from Kargil 1999 to Pulwama 2019, through Op Parakram and 26/11 — it is good that one outdated postulate of subcontinental conflict-management lies dead and buried. It was called bilateralism. All these conflicts have been de-escalated by the once-dreaded ‘third-party intervention’.

33,"Facebook, Telegram Working On Their Own Cryptocurrencies","More than 50 engineers at Facebook are reportedly busy giving shape to the social media giant’s own cryptocurrency and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is quite bullish on the project.Not only Facebook, highly-encrypted mobile communications apps Telegram and Signal are also on the job to roll out new cryptocurrencies over the next year, The New York Times reported on Thursday.“The most anticipated but secretive project is underway at Facebook. The company is working on a coin that users of WhatsApp, which Facebook owns, could send to friends and family instantly,” said the report, citing people familiar with the project. Telegram, with an estimated 300 million users globally, is also working on a digital coin.“Signal has its own coin in the works. And so do the biggest messaging applications in South Korea and Japan, Kakao and Line,a the report mentioned.With Facebook’s plan to merge its three platforms — Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram – the digital currency would reach nearly “2.7 billion people who use one of the three apps each month”.Last year, David Marcus, a long-time in-charge of Facebook Messenger, said in a blog post that he is setting up a small group to explore how to best leverage Blockchain across Facebook, starting from scratch.Facebook also promoted one of its senior engineers Evan Cheng as the Director of Engineering at its Blockchain division, signalling the importance of the project.According to Zuckerberg, the users may soon login to Facebook with Blockchain-based authentication.In a public interview with Harvard Law professor Jonathan Zittrain late last month, Zuckerberg said he is “potentially interested” in putting the Facebook login on the Blockchain technology.“I’m thinking about going back to decentralised or Blockchain authentication. Although I haven’t figured out a way to make this work out but this is around authentication and basically granting access to your information and to different services,” Zuckerberg told Zittrain.According to him, Blockchain could give users more powers when granting data access to third-party apps.“Like many other companies, Facebook is exploring ways to leverage the power of Blockchain technology,” Facebook said in an earlier statement."
34,India And Pakistan Are Both Losing The Forever War,"Every aspect of the current confrontation between India and Pakistan — which, I fear, may not be over yet — was avoidable. The initial attack on Indian paramilitary soldiers, in which 40 of them died, was claimed by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed, a terrorist group which has been allowed to thrive by that country’s military establishment. The attack itself required sophisticated organization and hundreds of kilograms of explosives. Not preventing it was an Indian intelligence failure for which nobody has yet been held accountable.After the attack, some form of retaliation was always on the cards, but the Indian government made the particularly risky choice of ordering airstrikes on a target within Pakistan proper. Although it claimed the strikes were a failure, Pakistan nevertheless chose to retaliate in turn. When it did, its front-line fighters had to be engaged by Indian warplanes that included the MiG-21, which many Indian aviation experts worry is too outdated for such duties. In the process, an Indian pilot was shot down and taken prisoner. While the pilot is being sent home, we in South Asia now live in a region in which two nuclear-armed adversaries send planes to bomb each other’s territory. This is a profoundly disturbing turn of events.: India produces proof, rubbishes Pakistan claim that F-16s weren’t used across LoC<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_2_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_2_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_2"" name=""aswift_2"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=1251830524&amp;adf=3972844145&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.3~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615631807&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Findia-and-pakistan-are-both-losing-the-forever-war%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615631807524&amp;bpp=2&amp;bdt=1223&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D8619f1ebe9a02799-22b4c3c6dbc6006a%3AT%3D1615631765%3ART%3D1615631765%3AS%3DALNI_MYvYx8HGagUE93qVlNApSKULML3Mw&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1018x280&amp;nras=3&amp;correlator=964261308639&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1422678832.1615631762&amp;ga_sid=1615631807&amp;ga_hid=856599404&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=7&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1624&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=44737536%2C31060287&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=587774124322707&amp;pem=867&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=3&amp;uci=a!3&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=JyePkpiUKX&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=18"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!3"" data-google-query-id=""CKCY3cCJre8CFZYB-QAdDIEAbA"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
Pakistan is busy congratulating itself on how things have turned out so far. This is unwise and premature. Premature because there is no reason to suppose that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi — who on Thursday called the airstrikes a ‘pilot project,’ implying they would be scaled up in the future — will be satisfied with anything other than the total rhetorical victory his camp followers in the Indian media have already promised voters. And it is unwise because the world’s reaction to the Indian airstrikes, unprecedented though they were, was notably unfriendly to Pakistan. Pakistani leaders — or, more precisely, the generals in Rawalpindi that really run the country — have few friends left. Even the People’s Republic of China urged only that ‘sovereignty should be respected’ — criticism, in its way, of both sides and not just India.Pakistan remains dependent on the world’s goodwill. Its economy survives from bailout to bailout. It needs to avoid alienating Beijing, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the International Monetary Fund all at once. And yet Pakistan constantly gets itself into these uncomfortable situations, where it finds itself provoking a confrontation with India, in over its head, and needing to call on a reluctant international community to rein in its incensed neighbor. The last few times, the generals’ dangerous indulgence of jihadist militants has been the proximate cause. But, the pattern has repeated itself over and over again since Partition in 1947; something deeper is at work.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=1251830524&amp;adf=1942844404&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.7~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615631808&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Findia-and-pakistan-are-both-losing-the-forever-war%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615631807515&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=1214&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D8619f1ebe9a02799-22b4c3c6dbc6006a%3AT%3D1615631765%3ART%3D1615631765%3AS%3DALNI_MYvYx8HGagUE93qVlNApSKULML3Mw&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1018x280%2C699x280%2C236x240%2C1017x613&amp;nras=6&amp;correlator=964261308639&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1422678832.1615631762&amp;ga_sid=1615631807&amp;ga_hid=856599404&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=7&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2162&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=44737536%2C31060287&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=587774124322707&amp;pem=867&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=4&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=igmrEUImr5&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=803"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CO2FisGJre8CFdUT-QAdmlEHnw"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
Meanwhile, for India, the lessons are equally stark. Its finance minister crowed in a poorly-timed press conference on Wednesday, the same day an Indian pilot was shot down, that India could now strike into the heart of Pakistan the same way the U.S. had taken out Osama bin Laden. This is an almost laughable over-estimation of India’s capabilities at this point in its development. You have to be able not just to get in but to get out, and be powerful enough to be untouchable thereafter. India has diplomatic support at the moment. But that goodwill has been bought by decades of strategic restraint and could easily be blown up by badly-planned adventurism.India is a huge country. It is young and impatient. But, its leaders do the country a serious disservice by trying to pretend that it can behave like a superpower before it builds up the necessary economic and diplomatic muscle. Deng Xiaoping famously told his country to ‘secure our position’ and ‘bide our time.’ In this, as in much else, India’s leaders have something to learn from Deng. India is large enough and grows fast enough that, just over the past five years, its economy has added three Pakistans. In a decade or so, if it focuses on growth and development, it will be better equipped to deal with problems such as Jaish-e-Mohammed. The best revenge is living well, as they say.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
As for Pakistan, if it wishes to retain the autonomy of decision-making that is true sovereignty, it had better work on strengthening its economy. Too often it looks to saviors — once the Americans, now MBS and Xi — as if pumping money in from outside is a sustainable solution. Per capita income growth in Pakistan is less than half that in India; it has already been overtaken by Bangladesh, once its poor and despised eastern half. If only Pakistan focused on its economy, it would no doubt find it less and less necessary to seek self-respect though its military.As I said, every aspect of this current confrontation was avoidable.

“Terrorism is destroying lives, destabilising regions and putting the world at great peril. The reach of terror is growing, its lethality is increasing and the toll it is taking is rising,” she said, while naming the regions across the world including Afghanistan, Bangladesh and India, where “we see the terrible face of terror”.The EAM said that the menace of terrorism cannot be fought only through military, intelligence and diplomatic means.“It is a battle that must be won through the strength of our values and the real message of religions,” she said, adding that there needs to be an all-round conversation between faiths and cultures.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
Swaraj, the first Indian leader to address the exclusive group of mostly Muslim-majority countries, pointed out that in each case terrorism is driven by distortion of religion and a misguided belief in its power to succeed.“The fight against terrorism is not a confrontation against any religion, it cannot be. Just as Islam means peace, none of the 99 names of Allah mean violence. Similarly every religion stands for peace,” she underlined.The EAM cited verses from various religious holy books to drive home the point that all religions preach tolerance.“This is not a clash of civilisations or culture but a contest of ideas and ideals,” she said.Highlighting the religious diversity and inclusivity of India’s culture, the EAM said that it is the “appreciation of diversity and coexistence that has ensured that very few Muslims in India have fallen prey to the poisonous propaganda of radical and extremist ideologies”.At the same time, the EAM said that the youth of the world are eager to see faster development. She said that the choices made by OIC will have a profound impact on humanity and called on the organisation to lift humanity to a “higher level of peace and prosperity” not just for “your people but for the world”.At the gathering, Swaraj pointed out that the OIC members constitute 1/4th of the United Nations and almost a quarter of humanity.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
“India shares much with you. Many of us have shared dark days of colonialism,” she said.Swaraj ended her address with a reference to Mahatma Gandhi.“I come from land of Mahatma Gandhi where every prayer ends with call for ‘shanti’ that is peace for all,” she said.Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Foreign Minister of United Arab Emirates, invited Swaraj as the ‘guest of honour’ to address the inaugural plenary.Pakistan, an OIC member, had tried to get the group withdraw the invite extended to India but failed. Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi then said he will not attend the meeting.The OIC has usually been supportive of Pakistan and often sided with Islamabad on the Kashmir issue. India was disinvited by the OIC in 1969 in Morocco at Pakistan’s behest."

Varthaman will now return home through the Wagah border which is around 25 km from Lahore in Pakistan.

Guterres had received a call Tuesday from Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi.When asked if the Secretary General is planning to get involved to try and mediate a de-escalation, Dujarric had said ‘as always’, the Secretary-General’s offices are ‘available should both parties or all parties, depending on the situation, agree to do that’.The spokesperson said the UN chief, through his contacts and others, is in touch with the relevant parties to pass along the message of the need to take steps to lower tensions and exercise maximum restraint.Dujarric said contacts have been made at various levels between the UN, India and Pakistan, but did not give further details as to which officials in India were contacted.Asked about the UN’s role at this point in the situation, he said that the Secretary-General is ‘kept apprised’ of the situation and he is following it.Tensions have escalated between India and Pakistan in the wake of the Pulwama attack claimed by Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). Forty CRPF soldiers were killed in the suicide attack in Jammu and Kashmir.India carried out air strikes against the biggest training camp of JeM in Balakot. In the operation, a very large number of JeM terrorists, trainers, senior commanders and groups of jihadis who were being trained for suicide attacks were eliminated.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>

“Hamza bin Laden is the son of deceased former AQ leader Osama bin Laden and is emerging as a leader in the AQ franchise,” a State Department statement said, referring to Al-Qaeda.The State Department said that it would offer $1 million for information leading to his location in any country.Bin Laden, who according to the United States is around 30, has threatened attacks against the United States to avenge the 2011 killing of his father, who was living in hiding in the Pakistani garrison town of Abbottabad, by US special forces.US intelligence agencies increasingly see the younger bin Laden as a successor to his father for the mantle of global jihad, especially as the even more extreme ISIS group is down to its last sliver of land in Syria.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 280px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 1018px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 280px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 1018px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden;""><iframe id=""aswift_4"" name=""aswift_4"" style=""left: 0px; position: absolute; top: 0px; border: 0px; width: 1018px; height: 280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""1018"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=3921124729&amp;adf=3113382301&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.9~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615631845&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fus-offers-1-million-reward-for-information-on-osama-bin-laden-son%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615631845663&amp;bpp=2&amp;bdt=1493&amp;idt=2&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D8619f1ebe9a02799-22b4c3c6dbc6006a%3AT%3D1615631765%3ART%3D1615631765%3AS%3DALNI_MYvYx8HGagUE93qVlNApSKULML3Mw&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1018x280%2C1017x613%2C699x280&amp;nras=5&amp;correlator=5713212798136&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1422678832.1615631762&amp;ga_sid=1615631844&amp;ga_hid=118320471&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=11&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1963&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=44737536%2C31060287%2C21068083&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=4382989852229487&amp;pem=867&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=5&amp;uci=a!5&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=8AmudZRbzz&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=34"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!5"" data-google-query-id=""COzb8dKJre8CFeUqrQYdYIAB7A"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
In 2015, bin Laden released an audio message urging terrorists in Syria to unite, claiming that the fight in the war-torn country paves the way to “liberating Palestine.”And in a message a year later, following in the footsteps of his father, he urged the overthrow of the leadership in their native Saudi Arabia.Osama bin Laden’s three surviving wives and his children were quietly allowed to return to Saudi Arabia after his killing.But Hamza bin Laden’s whereabouts have been a matter of dispute. He is believed to have spent years along with his mother in Iran, despite Al-Qaeda’s strident denunciations of the Shiite branch of Islam that dominates the country.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
Observers say that the clerical regime in Tehran kept him under house arrest as a way to maintain pressure on rival Saudi Arabia as well as on Al-Qaeda, dissuading the Sunni terrorists from attacking Iran.One of Hamza bin Laden’s half-brothers told The Guardian last year that Hamza’s whereabouts were unknown but that he may be in Afghanistan.He also said that Hamza bin Laden married the daughter of Mohammed Atta, the lead hijacker in Al-Qaeda’s September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States that killed some 3,000 people and sparked the US intervention in Afghanistan."
39,Vedanta Says It Loses 50 Million Rupees Daily Due To Smelter Shutdown,"NEW DELHI- Vedanta Ltd told an Indian court it has been incurring losses of 50 million rupees ($705,656) daily ever since the permanent closure of its copper smelter in May after violent protests against the plant led to the death of 13 people in police firing. The government of Tamil Nadu state ordered the smelter shut permanently on May 28 after bloody protests at the plant in the city of Thoothukudi culminated in police opening fire on demonstrators and shooting people in the head and the chest.Residents and environmental activists had demanded the shutdown of the copper smelter, India’s second-biggest with an annual production of more than 400,000 tonnes, citing air and water pollution. The oil-to-metals conglomerate had denied the accusations of pollution.“The petitioner’s unit has been and is continuing to suffer a daily loss of about Rs 5 crores (50 million rupees),” Vedanta said to the Madras High Court in a petition reviewed by Reuters.That translates to a loss of about 13.8 billion rupees ($194.49 million) since the plant was sealed shut nine months ago.Vedanta Group Chairman Anil Agarwal had said in July the company could face a loss of $100 million if the plant remained shut for a year.($1 = 70.8560 Indian rupees)"
40,Sensex Soars 265 Points As New F&O Series Opens Strong,"Mumbai: The BSE benchmark Sensex rallied about 265 points to 36,132 in early session on Friday as the March derivatives series took off on a strong footing and foreign fund inflows fuelled the uptrend.The 30-share Sensex spurted by 264.99 points, or 0.75 per cent, to 36,132.43 in early trade.

42,Jet Airways Shares Rise After Report Of Chairman Stepping Down,"Shares of Jet Airways Ltd jumped as much as 6 percent on Friday, a day after two sources told Reuters that founder Naresh Goyal had agreed to step down as chairman.Goyal, who founded the full-service carrier 25 years ago, has also agreed to reduce his 51 percent stake in the airline but would continue to be a part of the company in some capacity even after stepping down as chairman, one of the sources said.Jet, saddled with over $1 billion debt, had a rough 2018 as competition intensified in the Indian skies, the rupee depreciated and high oil prices squeezed margins.Jet did not respond to an email seeking comments. The company had said last week that its board had approved a rescue deal which will make its lenders, led by State Bank of India (SBI), its largest shareholder.The airline was also forced to ground another six planes on Thursday due to non-payment of dues to lessors, taking the tally to 19 which is about 15 percent of its fleet. It has a fleet of about 123, mainly Boeing Co planes, including 16-owned aircraft.The stock posted its biggest daily percentage gain since Feb. 15, hitting a high of 237.05 rupees.

43,MiG-21 Pilot Hailed For Elite F-16 Kill,"New Delhi: Indian Air Force’s (IAF) Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman achieved an unthinkable feat of bringing down a hi-tech two-seater F-16 using the vintage MiG-21 by firing R-73 air-to-air missile, said top defence sources on Thursday.‘The difference between a MiG-21 Bison and F-16 is like between a vintage Maruti 800 and top end Mercedes-Benz,’ said defence sources.Wg. Cdr. Varthaman’s MiG-21 was shot and he bailed out after bringing down one Pakistani F-16 fighter during a dogfight to repel a Pakistani attack on Wednesday morning. He has been in Pakistan since then.On Thursday, India exposed Pakistan’s lie that it did not use F-16 on Wednesday, an attempt by Islamabad to cover up its blatant violation of an agreement with the US that bars it from using the hi-tech jets for attacking India or any other country.Air Vice Marshal R.G.K. Kapoor, assistant chief of Air Staff, during a joint media briefing along with the Navy and Indian Army officials, showed media persons the wreckage of Amraam missile which Pakistan can only use in F-16, busting their claims that they never used F-16. The wreckage of the missile fell in the Indian territory during Wing Commander Varthaman and his colleagues’ dogfight with Pakistani fighters. The missile fired by F-16s had failed to hit Indian MiG-21s. India is likely to give the wreckage of the missile to the US.The advanced Amraam missiles allow a pilot to target an enemy aircraft that are beyond their visual range in day or night, and in all weather. While R-73 air-to-air missile of MiG-21 have a short range.There is also a possibility that the Pak F-16s used on Wednesday were either manufactured or upgraded in Turkey, said sources.To counter Pakistan’s denial on using F-16s, the IAF also talked of releasing video of the dogfight during which Wing Commander Varthaman went after an F-16. ‘We have got a video,’ said sources.Talking about the strike by IAF in Pakistan territory on Tuesday, the IAF said that it has ‘fairly credible evidence’ that there was intended damaged on Jaish-e-Mohammed’s (JeM) Balakot camp in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and it was for the Indian government on how to share it.‘There is a fairly credible evidence with us that there was damage in the camps and weapons hit the intended target and caused damaged that was intended. However, it will be premature to say that what is the number of casualties we were able to inflict on those camps and what is the number of deaths,’ said Air Vice Marshal Kapoor.Giving details of Pakistan jets’ attempt to hit Indian military installation fight on Wednesday, sources said that some 24 Pak air fighters approached India along the LoC. Out of these three-four Pakistani F-16 entered Indian airspace which could have hit brigade headquarters. Soon IAF planes, which included Sukhoi, MiG-21 and Mirage, were scrambled to intercept them. Two MiGs being near these Pakistani planes intercepted them. An airborne early warning and control (Aewc) aircraft too came near them and took over and started giving commands to MiGs.Wg Cdr. Varthaman came close to one of the two-seater F-16 and start chasing it. The F-16 started turning and soon a close dogfight ensured. The planes started moving up and down. Wg. Cdr. Varthaman fired the R-73 air-to-air missile bringing it down. In the process, his MiG-21 also got hit either near the LoC or in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK).Sources said Wg. Cdr. Varthaman achievement is significant because F-16 is a much superior plane as compared to MiG-21 and it had proved in during the Gulf war that it has higher manoeuvre capability, better speed, radars and systems. Despite this, Wg. Cdr. Varthaman was able to engage it in a dogfight. The hit on F16 was confirmed by the other MiG-21. Also, Indian Army aviation officials at the border saw the F-16 going down and two pilots bailing out using parachutes.In the initial statement, the Pakistan Army had talked of three Indian pilots being captured. But later, it changed its statement and said that Pakistan had captured only one Indian pilot. It seems that the two other pilots were those flying F-16 and hit by the MiG-21.According to reports emerging from Pakistan, when Wg. Cdr.Varthaman touched the ground in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) he asked the locals, who had surrounded, him if he was in India or Pakistan. Some of the locals told him that he was in India. Dawn newspaper said that then Indian pilot told them his ‘back had broken’ and he needed water to drink. Some youngsters at that point started shouting ‘Pakistan Army zindabad’.Immediately sensing his circumstances, Wg. Cdr.Varthaman shot fire in the air even as the youth picked up stones in their hands, said the newspaper.‘The Indian pilot ran a distance of half a kilometre in backward direction while pointing his pistol towards the youth who were chasing him,’ the Dawn reported. ‘During this brisk movement, he fired some more gunshots in the air to frighten them but to no avail. Then he jumped into a small pond where he took out some documents and maps from his pockets, some of which he tried to swallow and soaked others in the water,’ the report said."

45,Sushma Swaraj Takes OIC Stage 50 Years After India’S Big Diplomatic Embarrassment There,"New Delhi: The UAE’s invitation to India as ‘guest of honour’ at this year’s Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) summit is a watershed moment for New Delhi’s foreign policy.Since the OIC’s inception in 1969 as a platform of cooperation for countries with a significant share of Muslim citizens, India has had a rather uncomfortable relationship with the organisation on account of its tense ties with Pakistan.During the inaugural OIC Summit in 1969 at Rabat, Morocco, India faced severe embarrassment when it was officially invited to attend but subsequently asked to leave on then Pakistan president Yahya Khan’s insistence.ThePrint revisits the 1969 episode and then tracks how India’s relationship with OIC has evolved over the past five decades.What is Organisation of Islamic Cooperation?In the aftermath of the arson attack on Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem in August 1969, which was reportedly carried out by a Zionist, Saudi Arabia took the initiative to foster pan-Islamic solidarity. This initiative culminated in the creation of the OIC.Those seeking membership had to fulfill one of two conditions: Either have a Muslim-majority population or have a Muslim head of state. On a strategic level, the OIC symbolised a shift of the balance of power in west Asia from Egypt to Saudi Arabia.OIC met for the first time in September 1969 at Rabat. In an account published in The Wire and sourced from the Indian Foreign Affairs Journal, the then Indian ambassador to Morocco, Gurbachan Singh, recounted India’s experience at the maiden OIC conference.On the second day of the summit, Singh said, the foreign minister of Morocco summoned him to convey that the OIC had ‘unanimously decided to invite the Government of India to send an official delegation to the conference’.When Singh asked whether Pakistan was part of that consensus, the minister, he said, assured him that it was.As it would take a day for the official Indian delegation to reach Morocco, an ad hoc three-member delegation headed by Singh participated in the evening session on Day One. According to Singh, Khan was also present at that session and had exchanged pleasantries with him.The official Indian delegation, headed by former President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed (he wasn’t President at the time, but a Lok Sabha member), reached Rabat the next day. However, upon his arrival, Ali was told that India could not attend the meeting as Khan had threatened to stay put in his villa unless New Delhi was disallowed from attending the inaugural OIC.He had cited the 1969 Gujarat riots, in which several Muslims had died, to argue that India had no place at the OIC. Leaders of various countries are said to have tried to convince Khan, but in vain.According to Singh, they offered Ali two options: Either the Indian delegation accepts a change in status from ‘member’ to ‘observer’, or voluntarily abstains from attending the concluding session.The Indian delegation refused both offers and was eventually not allowed to participate, though the embarrassment did not end here. The preamble to the declaration referred to the Indian delegation as being that of ‘the Muslim community of India’.Furthermore, according to Singh, King Hassan of Morocco, in his concluding speech, ‘invoked the blessing of God on all and his protection to the Muslims in Palestine and India and wherever they were suffering’.This entire episode was regarded as a major diplomatic embarrassment in Delhi.Evolution in India-OIC relationshipThrough the 1990s, the OIC became a major irritant for successive Indian governments. Year after year, it would release resolutions condemning India’s actions in Kashmir, with the censure intensifying after the destruction of the Babri masjid in 1992.Former diplomat Talmiz Ahmed, who has served as India’s ambassador to Saudi Arabia, explained why in a column for The Asian Age : The OIC had no real significance, he said, except when Saudi Arabia needed ‘Islamic backing’ for its policies and got a resolution passed by OIC. In turn, it allowed other members to pass resolutions against whichever state they wanted, Ahmed wrote.Through the 1990s, India provided lengthy rebuttals to the OIC’s resolutions on Kashmir, until early 2000, when then external affairs minister Jaswant Singh decided that New Delhi would only provide a short statement on OIC resolutions, as noted by Ahmed in his column in The Asian Age.Since then, India’s relationship with the Gulf states has drastically improved.

46,Arsenal Keen To Close Gap On Spurs Ahead Of Derby Clash: Manager Unai Emery,"Arsenal manager Unai Emery believes the opportunity to inch close to within a point of Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League will be a “big motivation” for his players ahead of Saturday`s north London derby.Midfielders Mesut Ozil and Henrikh Mkhitaryan marked their sparkling return to form as Arsenal eased past Bournemouth 5-1 at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday.The win, coupled with Tottenham`s loss at Chelsea, means fourth-placed Arsenal head to Wembley this weekend four points adrift of their local rivals.“It is a big motivation,” Emery told reporters.“We need to take the opportunity like today, these three points. They are still ahead of us in the table, and it`s difficult to win there, but it`s a good test.”Mkhitaryan and Ozil both put themselves in contention to start the derby with a goal apiece against Bournemouth, but Emery refused to be drawn on whether the pair had done enough to feature in his tactical plans for the weekend.“I`m going to watch the match back, and Tottenham`s, and after that I will decide our gameplan for Saturday with every player,” he added."
47,Hamilton Test: New Zealand Restrict Bangladesh To 234 Despite Tamim Iqbal’S Attacking 126,"A hasty rewrite of the battle plan saw Neil Wagner bag a five-wicket haul as New Zealand ripped through the Bangladesh tail to counter Tamim Iqbal’s virtuoso century on day one of the first Test in Hamilton on Thursday.Despite Tamim’s heroic 126, New Zealand claimed the first-day honours when they reached stumps at 86 without loss in reply to Bangladesh’s 234.But for half the day everything had flowed Bangladesh’s way as Tamim led an assault on the New Zealand attack after being sent in to bat.The green wicket did not assist swing bowlers Tim Southee and Trent Boult and it took a switch to short-ball specialist Wagner to get results.“As a unit we started assessing how we had to bowl and how we had to try and bring ourselves back into it. I thought we did that really well and obviously got the rewards for it,” said Wagner who finished with five for 47 from his barrage of bouncers.“Tamim obviously batted extremely well and… made it quite hard for us and we had to fight hard to get those wickets.”Tamim, Bangladesh’s most prolific Test run-scorer of all time, laid the foundations for a potentially huge total when he laid into the bowling.He cracked 21 fours and a six as he feasted on fruitless New Zealand efforts, led by Southee and Boult, to find the edge of his bat.But there was minimal support, and after Tamim had steered Bangladesh to 180 for four, his dismissal triggered a collapse where the last six wickets fell for 54 runs.‘We have ourselves to blame’Liton Das, the last man out, had the second highest score of 29.“I had a very clear plan. If the ball was there to hit, I would try to hit it. Luckily, I got a few boundaries early and then kept on batting the way I liked to bat,” said Tamim, who believed Bangladesh left themselves 150 runs short.“It was a very, very good wicket. It was greenish, but it didn’t do too much. We should have scored a lot more than what we have put on. We have ourselves to blame.”New Zealand had an anxious moment at the start of their reply when Ebadat Hossain, on debut, saw his third ball in Test cricket fly from Tom Latham’s bat direct to second slip, but Soumya Sarkar spilled the straightforward chance.From there Latham and Jeet Raval knuckled down to bat unruffled through to stumps with Raval on 51, his eighth half-century, and Latham on 35.In a productive morning session, Bangladesh went to lunch at 122 for two with Tamim contributing 86, including 15 fours, as he showed that despite the green hue the wicket held no dangers.Wagner in that period took one for 13 off six overs, while Southee had none for 40 off six.One session later and Bangladesh went to tea at 187 for seven with Wagner’s figures improving to three for 29 while Southee was still being caned at one for 71.The pair cleaned up the last three wickets immediately after tea with Southee, while expensive, taking three for 76.Colin de Grandhomme only took one wicket but it was the key dismissal of Tamim who clipped a wide delivery to Kane Williamson at gully.It made up for de Grandhomme’s earlier error when he dropped a regulation caught and bowled opportunity from Tamim on 65."
48,New Zealand Cricketer Katie Perkins Dismissed In One Of The Most Bizarre Ways,"One of the most unluckiest ways to get out in a cricket match is when you hit the perfect straight drive but the non-striker is caught short of the crease and run out, if the bowler manages to get a hand to it. This, we have seen many times over.But in a cruel twist of fate, for once, the striker had to pay the price for playing a textbook straight drive because her colleague at the other end came in the way.In a match between Australia’s Governor General XI and New Zealand in Drummoyne Oval on Thursday, White Ferns (as NZ team is known) middle-order player Katie Perkins hit a low straight drive off the bowling of Heather Graham. The ball, hit with some force, was already past the bowler but it had still not hit the turf. And it just ballooned up after striking the bat of non-striker Katey Martin and Graham completed an easy return catch."
49,"Puma Signs Long-Term Deal With Manchester City, Replaces Nike As Kit Supplier","Puma has signed a long-term strategic partnership with English Premier League champions Manchester City, taking over from Nike as it seeks to make up for the loss of Arsenal to German rival Adidas, the sportswear company said on Thursday.British media have reported the deal could be worth 50 million pounds ($67 million) a year, more than double what Nike was paying, making it the third biggest in English soccer, behind Adidas`s sponsorship of Manchester United and Nike`s partnership with Chelsea.Puma Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden declined to comment on the cost but said that the agreement included a fixed retainer, a bonus depending on sporting achievements and a royalty component.“We think we are getting a fair deal,” Gulden told Reuters. “Man City is the best team in that league … they are very forward-thinking and extremely analytical with the way they approach the game and the business.”Man City beat Chelsea to retain the Carabao Cup on Sunday and is second in the Premier League and in with a chance in the FA Cup and European Champions League.Under Gulden, Puma has sought to rebuild its reputation in sports performance gear, signing a raft of sponsorship deals with top soccer sides, including German league leaders Borussia Dortmund, Italy`s AC Milan and France`s third-placed Marseille.“We need a major club in each market,” he said.The deal with City also includes sister clubs in Australia, Spain, Uruguay and China, and will go beyond on-pitch performance to football culture in areas such as music, gaming and fashion, Gulden said.Gulden said soccer sales in Europe were likely to stagnate or be lower this year after the 2018 World Cup, but other markets, such as China and Latin America, were growing."
50,"Chris Gayle Reaches 10,000 ODI Runs, 1st Batsman To Hit 500 Sixes","In another stunning performance since returning to ODI cricket, Chris Gayle broke a slew of records during West Indies’ fourth match against England on Wednesday, 27 February.En route to his 162 off 97 balls at St George’s, the 39-year-old ticked off a shopping list of targets – 50 up in 32 balls, a 10,000th One-Day run and then his hundred in 55 balls. He also became the first batsman in the world to smash 500 sixes in international cricket; earlier in the series, he had toppled Shahid Afridi to record the most number of sixes by any batsman in international cricket.However, Gayle’s fireworks weren’t enough to help his team cross the line as West Indies were bowled out for 389. They fell 29 runs short of England’s 418/6, scored courtesy Jos Buttler’s 150 and Eoin Morgan’s 103 as well as half-centuries by Jonny Bairstow and Alex Hales.Gayle’s 162 Off 97 Insufficient Against England’s 418-Run TotalGayle is the 14th batsman to cross the 10,000 ODI runs mark, and only the second from West Indies to do so after Brian Lara.“I think it just shows there are going to be unbelievable days of cricket and when someone like Chris Gayle’s in the opposition you can lose those games,” Buttler said. “We were put under great pressure and I thought the guys did well to stand up to it.”The veteran Windies batsman Gayle had on 17 February announced that he will retire from One-Day International cricket after this year’s World Cup in England and Wales."
51,"Airbus, OneWeb Launch First Satellite","A rocket carrying six satellites built by Airbus SE and partner OneWeb blasted off from French Guiana on Wednesday, the first step in a plan to give millions of people in remote and rural areas high-speed internet beamed down from space.A successful launch could mark a new era in the satellite services industry. Companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX, LeoSat Enterprises, and Canada’s Telesat are working to enable data networks with hundreds or even thousands of tiny satellites that orbit closer to Earth than traditional communications satellites, a radical shift made possible by leaps in laser technology and computer chips.The growth in satellites will spur demand for rocket launch services, and a handful of venture-backed rocket companies are developing smaller boosters to deploy the smaller satellites at lower cost.‘We are looking in the next five years at potentially 10,000 satellites needing to be launched and we don’t have the launch capacity at this moment to do that,’ aerospace consultancy Teal Group analyst Marco Caceres said.The Arianespace Soyuz rocket lifted off from Kourou, French Guiana, at 6.37 p.m. (2137 GMT) carrying satellites made by the Airbus-OneWeb joint venture called OneWeb Satellites in Toulouse, France.The refrigerator-sized satellites were expected to reach an altitude of 1,000 km (620 miles) more than an hour after launch. It could take 24 hours to fully assess the health of the satellites.OneWeb and others aim to expand the availability and speed of satellite-based internet compared to existing providers such as Hughes Network Systems, whose network is in a higher-altitude geostationary orbit. Hughes is also an investor in OneWeb and helping to build out its ground infrastructure.OneWeb has raised more than $2 billion from investors including Airbus, Coca-Cola, Virgin Group, Qualcomm Inc and SoftBank. It aims to have global broadband coverage in 2021 from about 650 satellites.OneWeb plans to begin launching more than 30 satellites at a time every month starting as early as September so its constellation is nearly 25 percent complete by year-end, a person with direct knowledge of the project said.Other firms say they are not far behind. Telesat, backed by Loral Space &amp; Communications Inc, is targeting 2022 for broadband services from nearly 300 satellites.Washington, D.C.-based LeoSat Enterprises says it has already signed more than $1 billion in pre-launch provisional agreements for secure data transfers for global banks, telecoms providers and governments beginning in 2022.FAST ASSEMBLY REQUIREDReuters reported a major shake-up last year at SpaceX’s Starlink project, which Chief Executive Musk has said is critical as a funding source for his broader space transportation ambitions but faces challenges on development and testing.A person with direct knowledge of the program said SpaceX was driving toward a first ‘production launch’ with money-making satellites in mid-2019.SpaceX already has two test satellites in space and plans to launch a new design based on those ‘soon,’ said one SpaceX official, who asked not to be named.SpaceX has not chosen a location to manufacture the satellites or made a final decision on how it will build, sell and service the terminals that will link the satellite-based internet to users, people with direct knowledge of the project said.Musk told employees in at least one meeting last year that SpaceX could decide to sell broadband to existing internet providers initially and worry about building out its own network later, according to a person who attended the meeting.SpaceX spokeswoman Eva Behrend declined to comment.A SpaceX official said its initial batch of satellites were currently being manufactured, and its internal launch targets were on track, but the company has not announced a launch date.The OneWeb project has forced Airbus to rethink the way it builds satellites, overhauling a painstaking, bespoke effort to introduce industrial methods and speed using assembly lines and automation.The two companies plan to open what they say is the world’s first satellite mass-production factory at Florida’s Kennedy Space Center in March for $85 million. Production will ramp up to 15 satellites per week at a cost of $1 million per satellite, executives say.OneWeb Satellites Chief Executive Officer Tony Gingiss told Reuters the goal is to be making two to three satellites a day by early summer.‘That’s revolutionary in an industry where it costs $50 million to build one satellite and normally takes months and a team of engineers to do,’ Gingiss said.OneWeb has ground stations in Canada, Italy and Norway that allow the satellites to communicate with Earth, and has signed a partnership with Qualcomm to develop the technology that links the internet from space to different users, such as airlines."

53,Blackberry Sues Twitter Over Patent Infringement,"BlackBerry has sued Twitter on patent infringement, accusing the open communication platform of illegally using its mobile messaging technology.The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court for Central California, seeks compensation for lost revenue and unspecified enhanced damages, CNET reported late Wednesday.BlackBerry has alleged Twitter infringed on six of its patents, like push notifications, silencing notifications for a message thread and mobile advertising techniques.“The lawsuit accuses the micro-blogging site of co-opting BlackBerry’s technology for use in several services, including the main Twitter app and Twitter Ads,” said the report. Twitter was yet to comment on the lawsuit.Software major BlackBerry in 2018 sued Facebook and its subsidiaries — photo sharing app Instagram and messaging service WhatsApp.The suit alleged that Facebook has infringed on some of BlackBerry’s patents including security features, mobile notifications, and combining gaming with messaging.“Blackberry’s suit sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business. Having abandoned its efforts to innovate, Blackberry is now looking to tax the innovation of others. We intend to fight,” Facebook had replied.BlackBerry also sued Snap, for allegedly infringing its patented messaging technology in the Snapchat app.In the fresh lawsuit against Twitter, BlackBerry alleged Twitter “has succeeded in diverting consumers away from BlackBerry’s products and services”."
54,"Taxpayers Need To Link PAN Card With Bank For Refunds, Says Income Tax Department","The Income Tax Department will “only” issue refunds via the e-mode into bank accounts of taxpayers beginning next month and they should link PAN with their accounts, the taxman said in its latest public communication.The department said refunds will be sent to bank accounts as it will issue “only e-refunds from March 1, 2019.” Link your PAN (permanent account number) with your bankaccount to get your refund directly, swiftly and securely, the department said in a public advisory issued Wednesday. It added the bank account could be either savings, current, cash or overdraft.Aadhaar-PAN card linking: Here’s how to do it and list of benefits you’ll getTill now, the department used to issue refunds to taxpayers either in their bank accounts or through account payee cheques, in a case-to-case basis depending on the category of taxpayers.The communication added taxpayers can check if their bank account is linked with their PAN by logging onto the e-filing website of the department–“https://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/”https://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in It said those who have not linked their PAN with their bank account should provide it to their home bank branch and also validate this over the e-filing website of the I-T Department.Recently, the linking of the PAN with the Aadhaar-PAN has been made “mandatory” for those filing an Income Tax Return (ITR) and this procedure has to be “completed” by March 31 this year.As per data updated till early this month, the I-T Department has so far issued 42 crore PANs, of which 23 crore have been linked with Aadhaar.While Aadhaar is issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to a resident of India, PAN is a 10-digit alphanumeric number allotted by the IT Department to a person, firm or entity."
55,Boeing Seeks UK Decision On Wedgetail Jet Buy This Year: Executive,"AVALON, Australia- Boeing hopes Britain will decide this year on plans to buy E-7 Wedgetail early warning jets, an executive said, after talks last year sparked a row over competition in arms procurement.Britain said in October it was in exclusive discussions with Boeing and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) about buying jets to replace its fleet of six aging E-3D Sentry planes without holding a tender.It did not give a timeline for the roughly $1 billion deal, but defence trade media reported that it wants the first jet in service by 2022.“We hope to have a decision this year,” Scott Carpendale, Boeing Defence Australia’s director of commercial derivative aircraft, told Reuters.“There are reasons why that is really important in terms of production availability and obviously the sooner they make a decision the sooner we make their aircraft. They are looking for that capability as soon as possible,” he said at the Australian International Airshow.Britain’s decision to skip a formal tender, on the grounds that this was the least risky option, angered European rivals Airbus and Saab which had proposed a joint offering. It led to an unusual public rebuke from UK parliamentarians who had pushed for a competition.It came as Britain prepares to take delivery of its first Boeing P-8 maritime patrol aircraft, also selected without a competition to fill an urgent capability gap. The early-warning and sub-hunting planes are both based on the 737 passenger jet.In a letter late last year to the British parliament’s defence committee, Saab said the Ministry of Defence had ignored an offer of a detailed briefing on the Erieye sensor system that it proposed to place on Airbus A330 planes, indicating a lack of interest in a bid.Defence sources said Airbus had also privately complained to the government.Carpendale said Boeing and other key suppliers had made sure they had room in their schedules to support production and they were providing data on how Australia had operated Wedgetail, but Britain was still going through the approvals process.Britain’s Ministry of Defence did not respond to a request for comment. An RAAF spokesman declined to comment.Australia, a close ally of Britain, has six Wedgetails in operation and has developed advanced proprietary capabilities that it could potentially share depending on government agreements and U.S. export approvals, Carpendale said.Early-warning systems like Wedgetail are designed to manage battles from the sky, tracking multiple airborne and maritime targets at the same time. They then use that information to direct other assets like fighter jets and warships.Australia has deployed Wedgetail in Iraq and Syria.RAAF Squadron Leader Martin Davies, who previously served on the E-3 in Britain’s Royal Air Force, said Wedgetail’s E-Scan radar was more advanced than the manual one on the E-3.Saab has said it offered to “cloak” the A330 plane electronically to make it more survivable and has denied that the Airbus jet and Swedish radar involved more procurement risk."

57,Oil & Gas Sector Update By Emkay Global,"10th CGD Round: Gujarat Gas and IGL wins six and three GAs respectively* The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has declared winners under the 10th City Gas Distribution (CGD) bidding round. AG&amp;P/IOCL/HPCL won the highest number of geographical areas (GA) at 9 each. In our coverage universe, Gujarat Gas/ Indraprastha Gas won 6/3 areas. GAIL Gas/Torrent Gas/Adani Gas/IOCL Adani JV (IOAGPL)/BPCL won 4/3/2/1/2 areas, while Think Gas/Rajasthan State Gas won 1 each.* GGL won lucrative GAs such as Sirsa, Fatehabad and Mansa (Punjab); Hoshiarpur and Gurdaspur (Punjab); and Jalore and Sirohi (Rajasthan), which saw 8-11 bids each. IGL won Ajmer, Pali and Rajsamand (Rajasthan), which also had 11 bids. AG&amp;P was the biggest winner with Sri Potti Sriramulu Nellore; Chittoor, Kolar and Vellore; Mysuru, Mandya and Chamarajanagar; Alapuzzha, Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram; and Chikkamagaluru, Hassan and Kodagu, which received 8-13 bids each.* The winning areas should add up to long-term growth of GGL/IGL, although we await more clarity on capex, volumes and margins. PNGRB will release the physical targets, after which management guidance would be clearer on the above parameters. We retain our earnings estimates while reiterating Buy/Hold on GGL/IGL with Rs170/325 TP.* AG&amp;P, IOCL, HPCL, GGL win big : IOCL, HPCL and AG&amp;P won 9 GAs each; AG&amp;P bagged lucrative properties in the South, which saw 8-13 bids each. IOCL mostly won around Bihar, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh (MP), while HPCL in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and West Bengal. GAIL Gas won around UP, MP and Jharkhand. Adani Gas won Anuppur, Bilaspur and Korba (MP, Chattisgarh); Jhansi (parts); Bhind, Jalaun, Lalitpur and Datia (MP, UP), while IOAGPL won Jaunpur and Ghazipur (UP). Torrent won 3 GAs in UP. Mahanagar Gas did not win any areas, albeit bidding for just 2.* GGL wins lucrative areas in Punjab and Rajasthan; Ajmer attractive for IGL : GGL won 6 out of 7 bids including parts of Ujjain, Dewas and Indore (MP); Jhabua, Banswara, Ratlam and Dungarpur (MP, Rajasthan); and Ferozepur, Faridkot and Sri Muktsar Sahib (Punjab). The company has bid strategically along proposed GSPL’s cross country JV pipelines which would help in securing tap-off. The 6 GAs cover 17 districts. IGL’s wins included Kaithal (Haryana); and Kanpur (parts), Fatehpur and Hamirpur (UP). The current coverage for IGL is 7 towns/districts in total. It applied for 15 areas.* Basic analysis implies value accretion of ~Rs7/5/sh for GGL/IGL : Although we await more clarity on targets that would be soon released by PNGRB followed by a clearer management guidance, normal/lucrative GAs could hit 0.4/0.8mmscmd volumes each in five-six years, as per our understanding. PNGRB has envisaged Rs500bn capex for the 50 areas in 10 years; hence, we believe GGL’s/IGL’s 6/3 GAs would have a cumulative capex of about Rs72/30bn. Margins could be better, particularly for GGL due to sizeable CNG volumes (50% share). Based on the above assumptions and Rs6-6.5/scm EBITDA, we estimate these GAs to boost current valuations by 6%/2%, although same would improve going forward. Execution is the key, as missing targets would lead to penalties.* Valuation and outlook:For now, we keep our estimates unchanged for GGL/IGL. We have Hold on IGL with a TP of Rs325. However, we find GGL attractive, given the recent stock correction and overall traction in margins from lower LNG prices. The company is confident of achieving 10% volume CAGR for the next four-five years. Reiterate Buy with a TP of Rs170."

The Security Council Sanctions Committee will have 10 working days to consider the fresh proposal submitted by the three members.The proposal is the fourth such bid at the UN in the last 10 years to list Azhar as a global terrorist.In 2009, India moved a proposal to designate Azhar, whose UN-proscribed Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) claimed responsibility for the suicide attack against Indian security forces in Pulwama on February 14 in which over 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed.In 2016 again, India moved the proposal with the P3 – the United States, the United Kingdom and France in the UN’s 1267 Sanctions Committee to ban Azhar, also the mastermind of the attack on the air base in Pathankot in January 2016.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>

However, on all occasions, China, a veto-wielding permanent member of the Security Council, blocked India’s proposal from being adopted by the Sanctions Committee.It remains to be seen how China will vote on the proposal this time.China, a close ally of Pakistan, has consistently blocked moves first by India and later by the US, the UK and France to designate Azhar as a global terrorist by the 1267 Committee by putting technical holds.France assumes the crucial rotating presidency of the UN Security Council in March. At least 40 CRPF personnel were killed and many injured on February 14 in one of the deadliest terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir when a JeM suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying over 100 kg of explosives into their bus in Pulwama district.India has strongly reiterated its appeal to all members of the international community to support the proposal to list terrorists, including Azhar, as designated terrorists under the 1267 Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council, and to ban terrorist organizations operating from territories controlled by Pakistan."

61,PM Modi’S 2 Options: Wait Or Step Up Hostilities,"New Delhi: India seems to broadly have two options after the capture of IAF fighter pilot Wing Cmdr Abhinandan Varthaman and the violation of Indian airspace by the Pakistani Air Force on Wednesday.New Delhi, which on Wednesday handed over ‘a dossier to the Pakistan side with specific details of JeM complicity in the Pulwama terror attack and the presence of JeM terror camps and its leadership in Pakistan’, now has the option of waiting and watching to see if Islamabad will take action.India is also aware its IAF pilot is in Pakistani custody and has already demanded his immediate and safe return. This may play a major role in determining New Delhi’s restraint.The second option is to keep the military pressure up on Pakistan and hit more targets of terror camps, thus sending a signal to Islamabad that New Delhi will not be cowed down. While accusing Pakistan of ‘using its Air Force to target military installations on the Indian side’, New Delhi has already told Pakistan that ‘India reserves the right to take firm and decisive action’ to protect its ‘sovereignty and territorial integrity’.As Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan warned India against any miscalculation and offered talks, Islamabad is also strongly conveying the message that it has not backed down and holds the aces in this battle of nerves, with the capture of the IAF pilot.Foreign policy experts note that the Pakistan PM is now projecting an image of magnanimity after showing Pakistan can retaliate militarily, having downed an IAF fighter and captured an IAF pilot. Islamabad is also likely to send out the message globally that it is treating the captured IAF pilot well and could use this to shape global opinion in its favour and attempt a propaganda coup.It may be recalled that the Pakistan PM had earlier urged India to provide proof of the involvement of Pakistan-based organisations with the Pulwama bombing. India’s submission of a dossier to Pakis-tan with ‘specific details of JeM complicity in Pulw-ama’ is also an important diplomatic strategy to ensure Mr Khan cannot use the excuse that India did not provide his country with proof.This is also seen as crucial to retain global support for India’s actions against terror.Speaking earlier on Wednesday morning at a trilateral meeting of the Russia-India-China foreign ministers at Wuzhen, China, external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, explaining India’s stand and its action against terror camps in Pakistan, said ‘India does not wish to see further escalation of the situation’ and that ‘India will continue to act with responsibility and restraint’.But this was before the Pakistani military respo-nse and the capture of the IAF pilot by Pakistan.Global pressure on both India and Pakistan to de-escalate and restrain themselves from further military action is also likely to increase. The United States had earlier asked both India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and avoid escalation. The same message had come earlier from Pakistan’s all-weather friend China."

Earlier in the day, the Ministry of External Affairs had said that a MiG-21 had been lost while a pilot was missing after Indian forces repelled three Pakistan Air Force jets which had violated Indian airspace. The Indian Air Force had shot down one Pakistani F 16 jet.Later, Pakistan released the footage of captured IAF pilot, prompting an immediate response from India with the government slamming Pakistan for the vulgar display of the injured IAF polit.As tension between India and Pakistan mounted during the day, the entire airspace north of New Delhi was briefly “vacated”. Nine airports in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab were closed for civilian traffic for some part of the day but was opened in the evening.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=1134506725&amp;adf=2608662361&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.9~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615632113&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Findian-high-commission-in-pakistan-demands-immediate-safe-return-of-captured-iaf-pilot%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615632113390&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=876&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D07bfc372ddebfeda-22a9fc96dfc6006a%3AT%3D1615632087%3ART%3D1615632087%3AS%3DALNI_Mb0-kumgSBttGBD7-zVaq6Yw0gulw&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1001x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=4667304092904&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1462997820.1615632085&amp;ga_sid=1615632113&amp;ga_hid=449566348&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=5&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1999&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=44731609%2C44737536%2C31060305%2C44737458&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=4149121294387609&amp;pem=702&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=tMuUqAnabr&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=17"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CI24ytKKre8CFdDX3godFTYK6w"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
Sources claimed that the PAF jets had entered the Indian territory to target an Indian Army Brigade headquarter and an oil depot but had to beat a hasty retreat after IAF jets came into action. The PAF’s jets only managed to drop their non-guided bombs at a considerable distance from the intended areas.“In that aerial engagement, one Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft was shot down by a MiG 21 Bison of the Indian Air Force. The Pakistani aircraft was seen by ground forces falling from the sky on the Pakistan side,” MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said on Wednesday evening. “In this engagement, we have unfortunately lost one MiG 21. The pilot is missing in action.”Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met the three service chiefs on Wednesday hours after Pakistani aircraft violated the Indian airspace. During the meeting, the three services chiefs apprised the PM about the country’s preparedness to deal with any possible retaliatory action by Islamabad."
63,Election Jitters To Keep India Stock Market On Edge: Reuters Poll,"BENGALURU- How Indian shares fare this year will depend heavily on the outcome of national elections in May, with market experts polled by Reuters saying a majority win for the ruling party would be the most favourable outcome for equities.Since hitting a record high of 38,989.65 on Aug. 29, the BSE Sensex index has fallen roughly 8 percent. This year, it is down about 0.3 percent, as there has not been the kind of recovery from late 2018’s deep equities sell-off that other major stock indexes have had.The absence of a 2019 rally partly driven by increasing uncertainty before the election, reflected in a second consecutive cut to 2019’s outlook in the latest quarterly Reuters poll of 50 equity strategists.The polling was conducted Feb. 13-26, before the escalation in tensions between India and Pakistan after both sides said they shot down each other’s fighter jets.The BSE Sensex is forecast to gain 2.7 percent to 36,960 by mid-2019 from Tuesday’s close of 35,973.71, just a touch lower than the 37,000 predicted three months ago. The index is then expected to rise to 37,975 by end-2019, a downgrade from 39,400 forecast in November’s poll.Late last year, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost power in three key states, handing Prime Minister Narendra Modi his biggest electoral defeat since he took office in 2014.“Despite the recent state election outcomes, the base case assumption continues to remain, with the incumbent party coming back to power for another term,” said Hitesh Agrawal, retail research head at Religare Broking.“This will be taken positively by the market, which likes certainty and continuity, especially on the policy front. Any other general election outcome will lead to a knee-jerk reaction.”RECOUPING LOSSES?But at best, Indian stocks are forecast to only recoup losses they incurred late last year.If the BJP wins a majority of seats, that would help the BSE Sensex gain over 7 percent in the election’s immediate aftermath, according to strategists who answered an additional poll question.However, if BJP falls short of a majority and has to form a coalition to stay in power, Indian stocks are expected to rise only half that much.If the Indian National Congress (INC) party wins a majority, Indian shares were predicted to rise about 2 percent immediately after the election. But the BSE Sensex is forecast to fall 3 percent if a INC-led coalition forms the next government.An alliance of regional parties would be the worst outcome, knocking the market down 7.5 percent in the vote’s immediate aftermath, according to the poll replies.Rajat Agarwal, Asia equity strategist at Societe Generale, said the equity market “is sanguine about politics at this point”.But while a return of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) under Modi’s leadership “should be hailed by the market, equity markets could de-rate in the near-term if the BJP loses,” he notedThe tepid outlook for Indian stocks also stems from a slowing domestic economy that has dampened investors’ interest in already over-valued stocks.India’s economic growth likely slowed again in the final three months of 2018 after a worse-than-expected performance in the prior quarter. The October-December growth number will be reported later on Thursday.The Reserve Bank of India, which surprisingly cut interest rates on Feb. 7, is widely expected to cut them again in the coming months according to a separate Reuters poll.That could also provide a boost to the market.Nearly 90 percent of strategists who answered a separate question said earnings growth, which has failed to rise at a significant pace over the past four years, will improve.Societe Generale’s Agarwal called the elections a “risk event for equity markets in the near-term.” But study of past ones “suggests that beyond the short-term reaction, the equity markets align themselves to the trajectory of corporate earnings,” he added.“The medium-term prospects of the equity markets are well supported by the earnings recovery, domestic liquidity and a new private capital expenditure cycle.”"
64,"U.S. Trade Chief Sees Long-Term China Challenges, Continued Tariff Threat","WASHINGTON- The United States will need to maintain the threat of tariffs on Chinese goods for years even if Washington and Beijing strike a deal to end a costly tariff war, President Donald Trump’s chief trade negotiator told lawmakers on Wednesday.U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer cautioned that much work was still needed to nail down a U.S.-China trade agreement, including working out how it will be enforced.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_2_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_2_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
“If we can complete this effort – and again I say if … we might be able to have an agreement that helps us turn the corner in our economic relationship with China,” Lighthizer said in testimony to the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee.The two countries have imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of each others’ goods, roiling financial markets, disrupting manufacturing supply chains and shrinking U.S. farm exports.Lighthizer said USTR was taking legal steps to implement Trump’s decision on Sunday to delay a tariff increase on more than $200 billion worth of Chinese goods that had been scheduled for Friday.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
But USTR later clarified in a statement that it was not abandoning the threat of increasing the tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent. It said a Federal Register notice would be published this week that would suspend the increase “until further notice.”Lighthizer detailed a long road ahead to resolve U.S. China trade issues, and said that tariffs would remain an important tool to push China to make structural policy changes sought by Trump and lawmakers.“The reality is this is a challenge that will go on for a long, long time,” Lighthizer said. He earlier said he “is not foolish enough” to believe that a single negotiation will change the increasingly sour bilateral trade relationship.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
“If there is disagreement at my level, the U.S. would expect to act proportionately but unilaterally,” Lighthizer added.A perennial threat of tariffs would be disappointing news for industry, which is hoping to see an end to the trade war uncertainty that has paralysed China investment decisions.Lighthizer’s cautious comments about a China deal prospects sent U.S. stocks lower in morning trade, but Wall Street steadied somewhat after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told a separate hearing that the Fed would stop shrinking its $4 trillion balance sheet later this year.‘MOST SEVERE CHALLENGE’The issues that the United States faces with China are “too serious” to be resolved by promises to purchase more U.S. goods and structural change by China is needed, Lighthizer said.China has offered to purchase an additional $1.2 trillion of U.S. products over six years, people familiar with the talks have said, which would be welcome relief to farmers and businesses hit hard by Beijing’s retaliatory tariffs.But lawmakers have urged the Trump administration not to allow potential big-ticket purchases to distract him from pursuing an end to what the United States alleges are unfair trade practices.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
China represents the “most severe challenge” ever faced by U.S. trade policy makers and congressional support has been “critical in persuading China” to take Washington’s concerns more seriously, Lighthizer said on Wednesday.The United States has accused Beijing of forcing U.S. companies doing business in China to share their technology with local partners and hand over intellectual property secrets. China denies it engages in such practices.Trump administration officials also object to non-tariff barriers in China, including industrial subsidies, regulations, business licensing procedures, product standards reviews and other practices that they say keep U.S. goods out of China or give an unfair advantage to domestic firms.Lighthizer on Wednesday said that while some progress has been made in the talks, the United States needs to be able to take unilateral action to enforce any agreement.“I don’t believe this is going to solve all the problems between the United States and China,” Lighthizer said. “We’re going to be back here and working our way through problems, always with one eye toward the future.”The United States is seeking monthly meetings for lower-level officials, quarterly meetings for vice ministers and semiannual meetings at the ministerial level for the enforcement process, Lighthizer said.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_6_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_6_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
Reuters first reported in January that the U.S. side was demanding such reviews of China’s progress on pledged trade reforms.Lighthizer also said the United States is seeking to prevent China from competitive devaluation of its yuan as part of a currency deal in the talks.He told lawmakers that the negotiations are to settle China’s violations of Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and therefore were executive actions that did not require Congress’ approval. The China talks have had more in common with a sanctions-monitoring regime than a traditional trade pact, focused on corrective actions by Beijing.‘SUBSTANTIAL’ PURCHASESWhile lawmakers from major agricultural states broadly shared their support for a deal that addresses these core issues, they sounded the alarm about the impact of tariffs. U.S. farmers have been among the hardest hit by retaliation from China, the top market for many of their products.Lighthizer said Trump’s team is pushing China to promise to make “substantial” new purchases of U.S. products, including soybeans, corn, ethanol and cotton.The purchase plan is designed to secure future demand as well, he said.“Our hope is if you increase those agriculture sales, you would create new customers and results that go out years and years and years and years,” Lighthizer said."
65,Air Strikes Will Help BJP Win Over 22 Seats In K’Taka: Yeddyurappa,"Karnataka BJP chief B S Yeddyurappa on Wednesday, 27 December said India’s “pre-emptive” strikes on terror camps in Pakistan has created a wave in favour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and will help the party win over 22 of 28 seats in the state in the coming Lok Sabha polls.BS Yeddyurappa”The atmosphere….day by day the wind is increasingly blowing in favour of BJP.Yesterday’s action of destroying terror hideouts by entering inside Pakistan has resulted in a pro-Modi wave in the country, the results of which can be seen in coming Lok Sabha polls.”Read all the live updates on the Indo-Pak crisis here.Speaking to reporters in Chitradurga, he said “It has enthused youths; all this will help us in winning more than 22 Lok Sabha seats (in Karnataka).”India conducted a major preemptive strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp early Tuesday, killing a “very large number” of terrorists, trainers and senior commanders.India’s action comes close on the heels of the Pulwama incident in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed in one of the deadliest terror strikes in decades in Jammu and Kashmir.Currently, BJP holds 16 Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka, Congress 10 and JD(S) 2.The ruling alliance Congress and JD(S), who have decided to contest the Lok Sabha polls together have begin discussions about seat sharing.Sharing of seats is expected to be a litmus test forboth parties with JD(S) demanding for 10-12 seats, while Congress has maintained that seat sharing will be based on merit."
66,"Trump Ex-Lawyer Cohen: Drugmaker Novartis Wanted Him To Lobby, He Refused","WASHINGTON- U.S. President Donald Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen testified on Wednesday that Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG initially wanted him to lobby for the company when it retained him with a $1.2 million contract, but that Cohen refused.“Novartis sent me their contract, which stated specifically that they wanted me to lobby. That they wanted me to provide access to government, including the president, ” Cohen said.“That paragraph was crossed out by me, initialled, and written in my own handwriting that says I will not lobby or do government relations work,” he told members of the House Oversight Committee.Novartis is one of several companies that paid Cohen through his firm Essential Consultants after Trump was elected in order to glean more insight into Trump’s administration.When news of those payments came to light last year, the drugmaker’s ex-chief executive said the contract was a mistake and he should have tried to fire Cohen in March of 2017.Cohen testified on Wednesday that he had offered Novartis in-person and telephone access “whenever they needed,” and estimated he spoke with the company about six times.“Six times?! Wow! $200,000 a phone call,” Republican Congressman Mark Meadows replied.Last year, former Novartis CEO Joe Jimenez, who had co-signed the contract with Cohen alongside general counsel Felix Ehrat, said: “We wanted to terminate the contract at that point, but in the end we decided there would be almost-certain litigation.”Novartis spokesman Eric Althoff, in an emailed statement on Wednesday, said the company “previously addressed all questions” regarding its relationship with Essential Consultants and considers the matter closed."

82,"After Surgical Strike 2.0, Imran Khan’S Political Party Mocks Bollywood","The Indian Air Force finally struck a blow to Pakistan by launching an attack in the wee hours of the morning and were successful in destroying terror havens in the region. As per sources, the Pakistani F16 fighter planes scrambled to retaliate against the IAF Mirage 2000s and turned back due to size and magnitude of the Indian formation.Now, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan’s political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) took to Twitter to mock the news about the surgical strike 2.0 by saying that Indian media heavily relies on Bollywood and called it “Hazardous and delusions of grandeur.” Check out the tweet below…However, the tweet did not satisfy their ego and they went on a tweeting spree mocking India, elections and everything under the sun trying to make themselves look good in front of thw world, which of course is failing miserably."
83,Jasprit Bumrah Could Script This Special Record In Second T20I,"Jasprit Bumrah could script this special record in second T20I Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah was superb in the first T20I against Australia in Visakhapatnam on Sunday.The right-arm pacer kept India in the match, till the last over, after bowling a brilliant spell of 3/16.Despite India’s last-ball loss in the tie, Bumrah was the standout performer.JB goes into the second T20I with an eye on a special record.Here is more.Bumrah could surpass Ashwin in T20Is Bumrah bowled a breathtaking penultimate over as he conceded only two runs, besides taking two wickets.His match performance saw him get to 51 wickets in T20Is.He became only the second Indian to take 50-plus wickets in T20Is after R Ashwin (52).Bumrah needs two wickets to surpass the off-spinner and become the leading wicket-taker for India.It would be a terrific achievement.Bumrah is a special T20I bowler After the loss in the first T20I, Indian skipper Virat Kohli lauded the fast bowler.“Bumrah can do wonders with the ball when it is reversing and did exceptionally well to get us in the game,” he said.Bumrah’s heroics in the 19th over saw him dismissing Peter Handscomb (13) and Nathan Coulter-Nile.He had earlier got skipper Aaron Finch (0).Second T20I: India will look up to Bumrah India will be hoping that the ace pacer is in his groove on Wednesday. India are in a must-win scenario to end the series at 1-1. The batting will need to support JB in order to keep India in the match."
84,Real Madrid’S Vinicius Praises Messi Ahead Of Clasicos,"Real Madrid’s Brazilian forward Vinicius Jr praised Barcelona’s Argentine Lionel Messi as an exceptional player, but not a figure to be afraid of.“He (Messi) is an incredible player, but he scares no one. We are ready to face him,” the 18-year-old said.The two Spanish clubs are to play each other twice within a week, starting with the second leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final on Wednesday at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, where Real Madrid is the host, reports Efe news. The second clash is in La Liga, scheduled for Saturday, also at Madrid’s home ground. The teams are tied 1-1 after the first leg.“The Clasico is always a beautiful game, always the best game to play. We are prepared for what is coming and to win. They are two important games and we have them within a week,” he said.Vinicius said Real Madrid had the best players in the world, adding they were capable of defeating their arch-rival Barcelona and reach the Spanish cup final.Real Madrid’s head coach Santiago Solari on January 26 praised Vinicius as the talented youth who has become a key player for the Spanish team in recent matches.Vinicius, who started the season with Madrid’s B-team, has been putting in outstanding performances and becoming both a reference for his team’s attack and a headache for rival defenses.“His adaptation has been very fast up to now,” Solari said at a press conference in Madrid on the eve of his team’s La Liga contest against Espanyol at RCDE Stadium.“He is young, just 18 and he has adapted to a new country, a new language, friends, a new neighbourhood and soccer culture, thanks to the team’s support, mature players,” Solari said.The Argentine coach also stressed the club has received a player as young as Vinicius very well, which has been the key for the Brazilian to “show his talent in each game,” adding they should “continue looking after the player to allow him experience constant growth.”Meanwhile, Messi on Saturday notched his 50th career hat-trick and assisted another goal in FC Barcelona’s 4-2 away win over Sevilla in La Liga."
85,Chinese Table Tennis Goes On War Footing For Tokyo 2020,"Shanghai: Chinese table tennis has gone on a war footing for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, vowing to dock coaches their pay and demote them if they fail to keep the country at the pinnacle of the sport.China top the men’s, women’s and team world rankings, while the country has won all 12 gold medals on offer across the last three Olympics.But open dissent broke out in 2017 when three of China’s top men pulled out of a home tournament in protest at the removal of head coach Liu Guoliang.The highly respected Liu has been back in favour since last autumn and this week labelled himself “commander-in-chief” as the Chinese Table Tennis Association laid out in stark terms its determination to clean up once more in Tokyo.Speaking at a media briefing on Monday, Liu — now CTTA chairman — deployed more militaristic bombast as he “vowed to advance and retreat with the team”, according to state news agency Xinhua.A points-based system of rewards and punishments for coaches under Liu’s new regime was “the most stringent in history”, Xinhua declared.The 43-year-old Liu said that he would forgo his salary for the year if any of the coaches under his watch fall short of the required number of points under the new assessment system.The coaches will similarly be hit in the pocket and demoted to a lesser post if they fail to reach the benchmark, which will be based on China’s performances in international competitions this year.As hosts, Japan will be a major threat at the Games, particularly in team events, Chinese table tennis bosses warned."
86,BCCI Pondered Over Making Foreign Players Choose Between IPL And PSL: Report,"The Board of Control for Cricket in India had contemplated making foreign players choose between Indian Premier League and Pakistan Super League, according to a report in The Indian Express. The idea was scrapped after discussion.According to the report, the members of the Committee of Administrators – Vinod Rai, Diana Edulji and Lieutenant General Ravi Thodge – and CEO Rahul Johri thought it would be inappropriate to tell foreign cricketers to choose as it was the IPL franchises, and not BCCI, that had bought the players.Several foreign stars, who are a prominent part of the IPL, also play in PSL. The names include AB de Villiers, Sunil Narine, Dwayne Bravo among others.India’s already-fractured cricketing ties with Pakistan worsened after the Pulwama terror attack.Several Indian cricketers – former and current – have censured the terror attacks. Harbhajan Singh, for instance, had called for India to skip their match against Pakistan in the World Cup.“There is no chance of a bilateral series with Pakistan after this incident. I agree that after this attack, India should not only stop playing cricket, hockey or football with Pakistan but cut all ties with them,” said Sourav Ganguly.Several State cricket associations have removed photographs of former Pakistani cricketers as a sign of protest against the attack."
87,India Eye Series-Saving Win Over Australia,"Bengaluru: The focus remains firmly on the World Cup but India would also be desperate to ensure that a home series does not slip out of their grip when they take on Australia in the second and final T20 International here on Wednesday.India are 0-1 down after an inexplicably poor batting performance led to a three-wicket loss in the lung-opener in Visakhapatnam.The below-par 126 with the bat on Sunday denied bowlers a decent shot at securing a win even though the Jasprit Bumrah-led attack did all it could to keep the home team in the game till the final over of the match.India skipper Virat Kohli has already said that his squad composition for the World Cup in May-July is “more or less sorted” but has not ruled out rewarding standout performances over the course of two T20s and five ODIs.Considering the captain’s current frame of mind, both K L Rahul and Rishabh Pant are likely to feature in most of the games against Australia.India rested opener Shikhar Dhawan to give game time to Rahul, who grabbed the opportunity with both hands by smashing 50 off 36 balls in his comeback game.He had a disastrous Test tour of Australia before he and Hardik Pandya were provisionally suspended for their loose talk on women during a TV show.The ban was later revoked though they still face an inquiry.With the series on the line, it remains to be seen if Dhawan is brought back into the side to open alongside Rohit Sharma or the team retains the opening combination which featured in Vizag.“Anything is possible now. We want to give game time to Rahul and Pant to figure out what we need to do in the World Cup,” Kohli said after the first T20.While Bumrah showed his class after coming back from a break, the other pacer in Umesh Yadav leaked runs and was not able to defend 14 in the final over.India could replace Umesh with Siddharth Kaul or bring in all-rounder Vijay Shankar to beef-up the batting department.The hosts played with a long tail in Vizag and that impacted their final total following an inexplicable batting collapse from 69 for one in the ninth over.Pant, a strong contender for a World Cup berth, will be itching to perform after getting out cheaply on Sunday, and so will be Dinesh Karthik, who is left with just one game to make a compelling contribution before the World Cup.All eyes will once again also be on Mahendra Singh Dhoni the batsman who struggled to an unbeaten 29 off 37 balls as India managed 126 for seven in Vizag.He was able to silence his critics with a solid showing in Australia and New Zealand but his rather slow innings on Sunday has got the tongues wagging again over his waning finishing abilities.Debutant leg-spinner Mayank Markande (0/31 in four overs) did not pick up a wicket but bowled well according to Kohli. The 21-year-old might get another game.Australia, on the other hand, will be fancying a rare series win against India in recent times, especially after losing the Test and ODI series at home to Kohli’s team.They would be happy with their bowling on a slow surface in the first game but made a mess of the 127-run target after cruising at one stage.Australia somehow got over the line but they know that India won’t be serving the series win on a platter and will come hard at them at the Chinnaswamy Stadium.Captain Aaron Finch would love to be back among the runs and the team will be expecting another blinder from Glenn Maxwell, who hit 56 off 43 deliveries in Vizag.Squads:India: Virat Kohli (c), Rohit Sharma, K.L. Rahul, Shikhar Dhawan, Rishabh Pant, Dinesh Karthik, M.S. Dhoni (wk), Krunal Pandya, Vijay Shankar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Jasprit Bumrah, Umesh Yadav, Sidharth Kaul, Mayank Markande.Australia: Aaron Finch (c), D’Arcy Short, Pat Cummins, Alex Carey, Jason Behrendorff, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Peter Handscomb, Usman Khawaja, Nathan Lyon, Glenn Maxwell, Jhye Richardson, Kane Richardson, Marcus Stoinis, Ashton Turner, Adam Zampa."
88,Oil And Gas Sector – Singapore GRM Up From Recent Lows But Still Very Weak By ICICI Securities,"Singapore GRM up from recent lows but still very weakKey recent developments / data-points in the oil &amp; gas sector are:* Singapore GRM at US$2.49/bbl in Q4FY19-TD is down 42% QoQ and 64% YoY; RIL’s Q4-TD GRM is estimated at US$5.2-7.3/bbl and OMCs’ at US$2.5-2.8/bbl.* Net auto fuel marketing margin is at a super-normal level of Rs4.7/l on 25- Feb’19, Rs5.59/l in Q4FY19-TD, and at Rs1.71/l (up 59% YoY) in FY19-TD.* US oil output was up 89k b/d WoW at 12m b/d while inventory was up 3.6mn bbls WoW in the W.E. 15-Feb’18, but US oil rig count was down by 4 last week.* GoI has approved E&amp;P reforms, which would mean lower/no revenue sharing and pricing freedom, thereby making future discoveries more profitable.* Total petroleum product, diesel and petrol consumption up 6%-13%in Jan’19.Singapore GRM up over the last four weeks but still very weak:Q4FY19-TD Singapore GRM at US$2.5/bbl is at a 37-quarter low and down 42%-64% QoQ and YoY. However, Singapore GRM was up 6% WoW and up 64% over the last four weeks to US$2.71/bbl last week driven by rise in diesel, petrol and jet fuel cracks. Sharp fall in US refinery utilisation to 69-70 week lows, fall in Singapore middle distillate inventory for four consecutive weeks, fall in US distillate inventory in four of the last five weeks and fall in US petrol and distillate exports last week appear to have boosted cracks. However, jump in Singapore middle distillate inventory last week, after fall for four weeks, may lead to diesel cracks correction from recent highs.* US oil production at record high, inventory up but steep Saudi output cuts, problems in Venezuela and Libya keep oil price high:US oil production rose to record level of 12m b/d in the W.E. 15-Feb’19. US crude inventory was up 3.6mn bbls last week and by 17.5mn bbls over the last five weeks and 4% above 5-year average levels. However, oil price has been supported by more than agreed production cut by Saudi Arabia, Libyan El Sharara field not restarting and worsening situation in Venezuela. Libya’s NOC has said EL Sharara oil field would remain closed due to continued presence of armed men at the field. Saudi Arabia cut output to 10.2m b/d (v/s agreed quota of 10.3m b/d) in Jan’19 and plans to cut output further to 9.8m b/d in Mar’19 as it shuts a refinery for maintenance. OPEC’s output in Jan’19 at 30.8m b/d is only marginally higher than IEA’s estimates of call on its output of 30.5m b/d in Q1CY19 and 30.7m b/d in Q2-Q4CY19. Thus global oil demand-supply is almost balanced despite rising US output. OPEC spare capacity stands at a comfortable level of 2.76m b/d due to the recent output cuts.* Super-normal net auto fuel marketing margin may boost OMCs’ Q4FY19E EPS by Rs0.7-12.2/share QoQ:Net auto fuel marketing margin is at a super-normal level of Rs5.59/l in Q4FY19-TD. If domestic and international prices remain at current levels in rest of Q4, net margin is estimated at Rs4.89/l in Q4FY19. We estimate higher auto fuel marketing margins to boost Q4FY19E EBITDA and EPS of: 1) HPCL by Rs28bn and Rs12.2/share QoQ, 2) BPCL by Rs31bn and Rs10.9/share QoQ, and 3) RIL by Rs5.7bn and Rs0.7/share QoQ."
89,Telecom Sector – Industry Growth Reviving By Motilal Oswal,"Industry growth revivingRJio gaining market share, racing fast to become India’s no 1 telco*The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) released the telecom industry’s 3QFY19 revenue report indicating industry (adjusted AGR*) growth turned positive during the period, albeit with a meager 1% QoQ growth to INR323b. Subscribers/ARPUs increased 0.6%/flat QoQ to 1,176m/INR92.* Unless there is a next round of tariff war, we believe that overall revenues and ARPUs should start recovering. But, it may not translate into sustainable growth for incumbents given the continued market share loss to RJio.* According to adjusted AGR workings, market share gap between the top-3 players is limited with Vodafone Idea/ Bharti/ RJio at 31.6%/30.1%/29.8%. RJio already ranks as No.1 in four circles and at its current growth pace, we believe it could turn out to be the market leader by next quarter.* The silver lining for Bharti is its growth/market share improvement in seven of the 22 circles that it is present in – an indication of its stabilizing competitive position, unlike Vodafone Idea’s two circles.* As Vodafone Idea’s 4G capability is weak, RJio would continue to target subscriber market share. Thus, we believe possibilities of ARPU accretion is 4-6 quarters away.Industry growth turns green with 1% QoQ growthThe telecom industry’s (adjusted AGR*) revenues grew 1% QoQ (declined 6% YoY) to INR323b. Industry subscriber base grew marginally by 0.6% QoQ (-0.7% YoY) to 1,176m driven purely by RJio subscriber growth, partly offset by sim card consolidation triggered by the recently launched Minimum Recharge Vouchers. This resulted in flat QoQ industry ARPUs (adjusted AGR) to INR91.7, which is 42% below the industry ARPU in 1QFY17 at INR160 (pre-RJio launch period). Unless there is a next round of tariff war, our channel checks indicate that overall industry revenues and ARPUs should start recovering in the next two quarters, as (a) a large part of the down trading is complete, and (b) shift of usage from feature phone to smartphones would benefit from nearly 3-4x ARPU differentials. However, this may not translate into sustainable growth for incumbents given the continued market share loss to RJio.Market share gap between top-3 players limited; RJio could be leaderRJio’s adjusted AGR market share has increased 360bp to 29.8% with robust (adjusted AGR) revenue growth of 15% QoQ (80% YoY), driven by 11% QoQ subscriber growth and 1% increase in ARPUs. RJio is now just marginally behind Bharti/Vodafone Idea’s (adjusted AGR) market share of 30.1%/31.6%, which has declined 90bp/120bp QoQ. At this rate, RJio could be ranked as the new No. 1 player in the market by next quarter, reaching there in just 8-9 quarters from the time of service launch. We believe that Bharti’s limited arbitrage v/s RJio on product/network quality and price plans should not only limit its market share erosion but should also result in gains from Vodafone Idea, which has plenty to do on improving its network quality and balance sheet repair.RJio is ranked no. 1 in four circles; Bharti seeing improvement in nine circlesRJio has reached the no. 1 position in four of the 22 circles – Rajasthan, Assam, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa. Bharti and Vodafone Idea are leaders in nine circles each. Despite the 4% QoQ decline in its overall revenues, Bharti saw growth/market share improvement in seven circles (on an AGR basis), a clear indication of its stabilizing competitive position. On the contrary, Vodafone Idea saw its declining revenues arrested in just two circles.Competitive intensity to remain high for the next 4-6 quartersRJio’s focus on subscriber market remains high, particularly in the feature phone category through its low-priced Jiophone offerings; contrary to industry channel checks that indicate Jiophone’s monthly subscriber addition has reduced to below 3m. As Vodafone Idea’s 4G capability is weak, RJio would continue to target subscriber market share. Thus, we believe possibilities of ARPU accretion is 4-6 quarters away. Bharti’s stronger network capability and similar price plans v/s RJio may continue to lessen its market share loss."
90,Option Strategy Ashok Leyland Ltd By Religare Securities,"Weak show; near term concerns remainAshok Leyland (ALL) reported weak set of numbers in Q3FY19 which were lower than our estimates. Its revenue de-grew by 12% YoY as overall volumes declined 6.2% YoY. The demand was impacted due to revised axle load norms, liquidity crunch amongst NBFCs and slower than expected growth in the export market. The operating margins contracted 140bps to 10.3% due to negative operating leverage during the quarter. While we do not rule out near term pressure in volume growth, we remain optimistic on FY20E volume outlook led by pre-buying before BS-VI implementation. Further, economic recovery and lower interest rates would augur well for CV growth. Hence, we maintain a Buy on the stock with revised target price of Rs. 98.Q3FY19 Result Update:* ALL’s net revenue declined by 12% YoY to Rs. 6,325 cr driven by overall volume de-growth of 6.2% (MH&amp;CV volumes down 16.6% and LCV volumes up by 27.7%). The MH&amp;CV volumes were impacted due to revised axle load norms which allowed higher carry loads, liquidity crunch amongst NBFCs and slow growth in export markets (Middle East and Sri Lanka). We expect volume growth to remain muted for the next two quarters owing to high base and political uncertainty. Nonetheless, we believe pre-buying would aid volume growth for the company in H2FY20.* EBITDA de-grew by 22.5% YoY in Q3FY19 to Rs. 649 cr, while margins contracted 138bps to 10.3%. The contraction was mainly on account of higher discounts due to competitive forces and negative operating leverage during the quarter. Net profit de-grew by 21.5% to Rs. 381 cr which was lower than our estimates. PAT margins contracted 67bps to 6.1% in Q3FY19. We expect the margin trajectory to improve from Q4FY19E given easing cost pressures, cost saving initiatives and recent price hike taken by the company.* Other key highlights:i) ALL covers ~45% of LCV opportunity and going forward it plans to target the intermediate CV segment, ii) Exports slowed down in Q3 mainly because of weak demand from the Middle East and Sri Lanka, however the management is positive on the demand coming from Sri Lanka once there is political stability iii) The management expects pre-buying demand to start coming in from Q2 and Q3 of FY20 as buyers might want to avoid last minute purchase in Q4 because of price increase if any.Outlook &amp; Valuation:Post a strong H1FY19, the domestic CV industry witnessed significant pressure due to the impact of revised axle load norms and liquidity crunch amongst NBFCs. Further, higher discounts due to competitive pressure and higher cost pressures led to a sharp margin contraction. Going forward, notwithstanding the near term weakness, we expect a strong H2FY20 led by pre-buying before BS-VI implementation. Further, implementation of CV scrappage policy would provide a fillip to volume growth. Nonetheless, we have lowered our volume/revenue forecast for FY19E, FY20E and FY21E factoring the impact of recent weakness in volume growth. On the margins front, we expect the margin trajectory to improve from Q4FY19E due to easing cost pressures, price hike taken by the company and cost saving initiatives. Additionally, ALL’s increased focus on its LCV business and other businesses like Spares, Defence and Exports augurs well for the company. Hence, we maintain a Buy on the stock with a revised target price of Rs. 98"
91,"RBI Proposes New Compensation Norms For Top Officials Of Private, Foreign Banks","The RBI Monday proposed that at least 50 per cent of compensation of senior officials of private and foreign banks, including whole time directors and chief executive officers, “should be variable”. A discussion paper on proposed guidelines for compensation of whole time directors/chief executive officers/material risk takers and control function staff issued by the central bank also said ESOPs should be included as a component of variable pay. In January 2012, the Reserve Bank had issued the compensation guidelines for implementation by private sector and foreign banks from the financial year 2012-13.“These (2012) guidelines are being reviewed, with an objective to better align with FSB (Financial Stability Board) Principles and Implementation Standards, based on experience and evolving international best practices,” the RBI said while inviting comments from stakeholders by March 31. The proposed guidelines, to be effective from the ensuing financial year (post issue of the final guidelines), further said, “Variable pay is to be capped at 200 per cent of fixed pay.” As per the extant guidelines, the variable pay is capped at 70 per cent of fixed pay but did not include ESOPs.The proposed guidelines also said minimum 50 per cent of variable pay is to be via non-cash component while mandating a compulsory deferral mechanism for variable pay, regardless of quantum of variable pay. “It should be ensured that there is a proper balance between fixed pay and variable pay. The total variable pay shall be limited to a maximum of 200 per cent of the fixed pay (for the relative period). “Within this ceiling, at higher levels of responsibility, the proportion of variable pay should be higher.The deterioration in the financial performance of the bank should generally lead to a contraction in the total amount of variable compensation paid,” the paper said. The paper said banks are required to put in place appropriate modalities to incorporate malus/clawback mechanism in respect of variable pay, taking into account relevant statutory and regulatory stipulations as applicable. “Wherever the assessed divergence in bank’s asset classification or provisioning from the RBI norms exceeds the prescribed threshold for public disclosure, the bank shall not pay the unvested portion of the variable compensation for the assessment year under ‘malus’ clause,” it said.Further, in case of divergence, no proposal for increase in variable pay (for the assessment year) should be entertained, it added. While floating the discussion paper, the RBI said compensation practices, especially of large financial institutions, were one of the important factors which contributed to the global financial crisis in 2008. Employees were too often rewarded for increasing the short-term profit without adequate recognition of the risks and long-term consequences that their activities posed to the organisations. “These perverse incentives amplified the excessive risk taking that severely threatened the global financial system.The compensation issue has, therefore, been at the centre stage of the regulatory reforms,” the RBI said. The Financial Stability Forum (later the Financial Stability Board) in 2009 brought out a set of Principles and Implementation Standards on sound compensation practices. The guidelines have been proposed for private sector banks, including Local Area Banks, Small Finance Banks and Payments Banks. For the foreign banks operating in India by way of Wholly Owned Subsidiary structure, the guidelines as applicable for private sector banks in India will be applicable, the paper said."

The government will give a subsidy of Rs 105 per kilowatt on the electricity given under the agriculture connection. Now the fixed charge to the farmers will be Rs 20 per KW,” Gahlot tweeted in Hindi.The fixed electricity charge for agriculture use in Delhi was Rs 125 per kilowatt per month as per the tariff schedule. The farmers of the national capital were not happy with the ruling Aam Aadmi Party on the issue of high electricity charges.”If a farmer has an electricity metre of 10 kilowatts to run a tubewell, he has to pay a minimum of Rs 1,250 per month. The charge increase with the increase in the kilowatt. This is excluding the charges we have to pay for usage,” a farmer told IANS.At times, the farmers had to pay over Rs 4,000 per month for the electricity which was increasing the overall cost of production."

97,"US Senators Unconvinced By Saudi Briefing, See Yemen War Vote Next Week","WASHINGTON: US senators said on Monday a Trump administration briefing had not changed opinions on the need to push back at Saudi Arabia over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and its conduct in the war in Yemen, and predicted a Senate vote on whether to end US involvement in Yemen as soon as next week.Officials from the US State and Defence Departments met with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee behind closed doors on Monday to discuss the situation in Yemen, amid a months-long outcry in Congress about Saudi Arabia.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_2_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_2_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
“I don`t think they won any hearts and minds,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy told reporters as he left the briefing. Critics of Riyadh, including some of President Donald Trump`s fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, have blasted a Saudi-led coalition waging an air campaign in Yemen`s civil war over high civilian casualties.They also were outraged about Khashoggi`s killing last year at a Saudi consulate in Turkey, and, more recently, the administration`s failure to meet a deadline to report to Congress about whether Saudi officials and members of the royal family, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, were behind the death of the Saudi journalist, a legal US resident who wrote for The Washington Post.In Saudi Arabia, 11 suspects have been indicted in the murder, and officials have rejected accusations that the crown prince ordered the killing. Senator Jim Risch, the committee`s Republican chairman, declined comment as he left the briefing. But he said in a statement earlier on Monday that the administration has been “in constant communication” with him about the investigation into Khashoggi`s killing.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
Risch said the committee also planned a separate classified briefing with the administration this week in relation to Global Magnitsky human rights sanctions and Saudi Arabia. Republican and Democratic lawmakers triggered a provision of the Global Magnitsky human rights act in October, giving the administration 120 days until Feb. 8 to report on who was responsible for the death of Khashoggi and whether the United States would impose sanctions on that person or persons.Members of Congress have introduced several pieces of legislation seeking to push back against Riyadh. This month, the Democratic-led US House of Representatives approved a rare war powers resolution seeking to end US support for the Saudi Arabia-led coalition in Yemen.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>

102,PM Modi Chairs CCS Meet After India Hits Terror Camps Across LoC; Over 200 Terrorists Killed,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security at Lok Kalyan Marg hours after India had carried out pre-dawn air strikes on terror camps across the Line of Control on Tuesday.Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj were at the meeting, apart from National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and other officials.In a 21-minute offensive, 12 Mirage 2000 jets carried out the strike at around 3.30 am and dropped 1000 Kg bombs on terror camps across LOC, completely destroying it. Indian Air Force (IAF) sources were quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) control rooms were also reportedly destroyed.The IAF jets struck terror camps and launch pads across the LoC in Balakot at around 3.45 am, Muzaffarabad at around 3.48 am and Chakoti at around 3.58 am.One of the targets destroyed by Indian fighter jets was reportedly in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa area. Strikes in the region were based on locations provided by on-ground intelligence sources.According to a report by NDTV, the IAF strike has led to 200-300 casualties on the Pakistani side.According to sources quoted by ANI, Pakistani F16s were scrambled to retaliate against IAF Mirage 2000s but turned back due to the size of Indian formation. Western Air Command coordinated the operation.Laser guided bombs were reportedly used for the assault.The 12 Mirage 2000 jets that participated in the operation have returned safely, reports said.Following the attack, the Indian Air Force has put on high alert across all air defence systems along the international border and LoC to respond to any possible action by the Pakistan Air Force.Meanwhile, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has summoned an emergency meeting to review the situation after Indian Air Force strikes.Earlier in the day, Pakistan Armed Forces spokesperson Major General Asif Ghafoor had claimed Indian aircraft crossed over from the “Muzaffarabad sector” and released payload near Balakot “in haste” after facing “effective response from Pakistan Air Force”.Ghafoor made the claim in his three tweets posted on Tuesday morning.“Indian Air Force violated Line of Control. Pakistan Air Force immediately scrambled. Indian aircrafts gone back. Details to follow,” Ghafoor’s first tweet read.He further added soon: “Indian aircrafts intruded from Muzaffarabad sector. Facing timely and effective response from Pakistan Air Force released payload in haste while escaping which fell near Balakot. No casualties or damage.”In another tweet posted at 8.41 am, Ghafoor shared four photographs and said the payload dropped by “hastily escaping Indian aircrafts” fell in an open area.Reacting to the offensive, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said, “We acted in 100 hours after the Pulwama terror attack. Today’s action had to be taken. People have trust in Modi ji. This step was important. Modi ji gave freedom to Army to act”.The Prime Minister had in many of his public speeches after the attack, said that the security forces have been given full freedom to decide the future course of action regarding the terrorist attack in Pulwama.The development comes amid heightened tension between India and Pakistan following the 14 February suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Jammu and Kashmir in which 44 jawans were killed. Pakistan-based and supported terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed had claimed responsibility for the attack, which is being investigated by the NIA. Soon after the attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said security forces had been given a free hand to avenge the act.On Monday, Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa apparently met Air Chief Marshal Mujahid Anwar Khan and they deliberated on the operational environment including threat and response.Quoting Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor, a PTI report said: “Both chiefs expressed satisfaction on readiness, coordination and synergy. Pakistan Armed Forces are fully prepared for a befitting response to any Indian aggression or misadventure.”"

“We have no choice but to – as rapidly as possible – look to move production away from China,” said Arnold Kamler, chief executive and majority owner of the Parsippany, N.J.-based bike company.But Kent and other bike makers don’t have to move their manufacturing operations to the United States to avoid tariffs – nor do they have to stop using Chinese parts.The company now plans to make bike frames in Cambodia while continuing to buy about half the components it will attach to those frames from producers in China. The resulting bicycles can enter the United States tariff-free because of U.S. rules that generally allow products to be designated as made-in-Cambodia as long as 35 percent of their costs for parts and labor are derived from that country.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=3389523915&amp;adf=2462486765&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.7~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615632570&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fhow-u-s-bike-companies-are-steering-around-trumps-china-tariffs%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615632570787&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=890&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3Dd3ac7bf15dbb3488-22b7ea1ae1c6009e%3AT%3D1615632541%3ART%3D1615632541%3AS%3DALNI_MaOAGE8TnWP0DXqhyRZO-hr5PcHJQ&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=1182657133751&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1990766852.1615632539&amp;ga_sid=1615632570&amp;ga_hid=983059838&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=6&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1848&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=42530672%2C31060428&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=3954069187696153&amp;pem=589&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=2Xe2eSwfzl&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=26"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CJey06yMre8CFdN6Ygodz8EL5Q"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
Gaming the so-called rules of origin is a legal tariff-avoidance strategy being adopted by other major U.S. bike builders and explored across the industry, along with other manufacturing sectors, according to bike executives and supply chain consultants.The shift in the $6 billion bike industry underscores how such rules allow manufacturers, despite tariffs, to continue sourcing large portions of their parts from China, undermining the Trump administration goal of boosting U.S. manufacturing employment. It further shows how quickly light manufacturers with less capital-intensive operations can move to Southeast Asia, which has seen a blitz of new investment since Trump launched his first tariffs last spring.The bike industry plays a small role in what experts call the biggest shake-up in cross-border supply chains since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Companies in an array of industries – furniture, electronics, apparel, tires, vacuum cleaners, to name a few – are moving operations to Vietnam, Thailand and other Asian countries, often while continuing to use some suppliers in China.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_4"" name=""aswift_4"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=3389523915&amp;adf=3550161029&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.13~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615632571&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fhow-u-s-bike-companies-are-steering-around-trumps-china-tariffs%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615632570770&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=873&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3Dd3ac7bf15dbb3488-22b7ea1ae1c6009e%3AT%3D1615632541%3ART%3D1615632541%3AS%3DALNI_MaOAGE8TnWP0DXqhyRZO-hr5PcHJQ&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280%2C699x280%2C699x280%2C236x240&amp;nras=6&amp;correlator=1182657133751&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1990766852.1615632539&amp;ga_sid=1615632570&amp;ga_hid=983059838&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=6&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2291&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=42530672%2C31060428&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=3954069187696153&amp;pem=589&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;cms=2&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=5&amp;uci=a!5&amp;btvi=4&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=Tz3jy6BpiM&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=524"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!5"" data-google-query-id=""CJDL8ayMre8CFfOhpwodVBsEiQ"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
“This is a mid- to long-term issue that is not going to blow over in a year,” said Brett Weaver, a supply-chain consultant at KPMG. “More and more companies are beginning to take that perspective.”The Trump administration’s office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) did not respond to requests for comment.RISING CHINA LABOR COSTSFor many companies, tariffs proved the deciding factor in moves already under consideration because of rising labor costs in China. Three decades ago, when Kamler first offshored Kent’s production, labor in China cost him 20 percent less than in the United States. That gap has narrowed to 5 percent, he said.Kent currently sources nearly 90 percent of the 3 million bicycles it sells to Target, Walmart and other U.S. retailers from China. But sales took a hit after it raised prices in response to tariffs last September.Kent’s new factory in Cambodia is estimated to cost $20 million – an amount equivalent to one year of Kent’s increased costs from Trump’s 10 percent tariffs, which were added to existing duties. Trump’s tariffs were set to rise to 25 percent on March 2, but on Sunday he delayed the increase, citing progress in trade talks with China.Another major brand, Specialized Bicycle Components, has moved production from China to Cambodia, Vietnam and Taiwan, expanding its existing Southeast Asia operations, said Bob Margevicius, a vice president of the Morgan Hill, California-based bike maker. Smaller producer Pure Bicycles, based in Los Angeles, is preparing a move to Vietnam, said Michael Fishman, president of the Los Angeles-based firm.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
Industry officials and supply chain consultants say all American bike-makers are considering similar moves to shield their low-margin businesses from tariffs.“Their supply chains are disrupted,” said Morgan Lommele, a director at PeopleForBikes, an industry association. “They are looking at other countries.”‘A WAKE-UP CALL’All manufacturers face challenges in moving their operations to Southeast Asia, including constraints on port capacity and labor. And no country can easily supplant China’s scale and production volumes for bicycles after three decades of the industry migrating there from the United States.In the 1970s, U.S.-based firms made more than 15 million bicycles annually, compared to fewer than 500,000 now, according to the data presented by the industry to the USTR last year. And 94 percent of U.S. bike imports currently come from China, U.S. Census data shows.China also provides more than 300 million components such as tires, tubes, seats and handlebars – accounting for about 60 percent total component imports.Specialized finished moving all its production out of China by December but, like Kent, will continue to buy components from there.Trump’s tariffs provided a “wake-up call for the industry,” said Margevicius, who also serves on the board of an industry trade group, the Bicycle Product Suppliers Association.CHINA FIGHTS BACKChinese authorities are keen to protect manufacturing jobs, too. To cushion the impact of tariffs, China has increased export tax rebates and quickened tax refunds to exporters, Margevicius said. It is also offering companies cheap loans.A more than 5 percent decline in the value of the Chinese Yuan last year, along with forecasts of further depreciation this year, are also helping blunt the impact of higher U.S. duties.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_6_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_6_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
Kent is, nonetheless, moving ahead with plans to start manufacturing in Cambodia in September, and Kalmer said it will shift the bulk of its production there over the long term. Lower labor costs were a major deciding factor in addition to tariffs, said Kalmer, who remains skeptical that Beijing will sustain its tax incentives to lower-end manufacturers as its economy shifts towards services, consumption and high-tech production.South East Asian countries are also wooing firms exploring options outside China.Cambodia has allowed Kent to bring in short-term workers from China. Thailand is promoting itself as a regional manufacturing hub, offering incentives such as an exemption of up to eight years on corporate income tax for certain industries and exemptions on import duties for some raw materials.Vietnam has finalized 16 free trade agreements including with the European Union and is a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, offering companies almost duty-free access to big bike markets from Germany to Australia.LOGISTICAL HURDLESSpecialized’s Margevicius advises companies considering a move to look carefully at whether locations outside China have the required infrastructure to meet their needs.Each of the two biggest ports in Vietnam, for instance, has only a sixth of the capacity of the port of Shanghai, and Cambodia lacks a deep-water port to accommodate larger vessels.The rush of manufacturers moving operations to Southeast Asia will also bring new competition to hire and train workers from a labor force far smaller than that of China.Kamler is not deterred. Kent’s Chinese partner has already bought a plot for the Cambodian factory, five miles from downtown Phnom Penh. Construction is scheduled to start next month and finish by June.The company will initially hire and train up to 300 workers to start the production. It will also bring in 100 robots from its Chinese facilities for welding work.“We have a big business in the United States,” Kamler said. “My priority 1,2,3 and 4 is to rescue my USA business.”"
104,U.S. Business Lobby Says Most Firms Favour Tariffs While China Trade Talks Underway,"BEIJING- A top U.S. business lobby in China said on Tuesday that a majority of its member companies favoured the United States retaining tariffs on Chinese goods while Washington and Beijing try to hammer out a deal to end a months-long trade war.The American Chamber of Commerce in China also said over the past year substantially more of its members are wanting the U.S. government to push Beijing harder to create a level playing field for U.S. business.U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that he may soon sign an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping to end the trade dispute if their countries can bridge remaining differences, saying negotiators were “very, very close” to a deal.That followed Trump’s announcement a day earlier that he would delay a tariff hike on $200 billion of Chinese goods and extend his March 1 deadline for a deal. Washington is demanding an end to the theft of trade secrets and practices that coerce U.S. companies to turn over technology to Chinese firms.About 10 percent of the chamber’s members favoured raising tariffs rates on those $200 billion of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent after the original March 1 deadline agreed to by Trump and Xi in December.Another 43 percent advocated maintaining tariffs at 10 percent and delaying the increase for 60 days while negotiations continued, the chamber said at a briefing on its annual China business climate survey.“There are mixed feelings about the tariffs, but a majority are in support of the tariffs continuing at the present time,” chamber chairman Tim Stratford said at the briefing.“People don’t like tariffs, and that’s truly understandable. But they also think that maybe the tariffs have done some good in provoking very serious negotiations between the two sides,” Stratford told Reuters earlier.Chamber president Alan Beebe said 47 percent of members wanted the U.S. government to “advocate more strongly” for a level playing field for U.S. business in the world’s second largest economy.“That figure is almost twice of what it was a year ago,” Beebe said.The chamber said 19 percent of its companies were adjusting supply chains or seeking to source components and assembly outside of China as a result of tariffs. Twenty-eight percent were delaying or cancelling investment decisions in China.Trump’s decision to delay the tariff increase has been greeted with a mixture of relief and dread among U.S. industry groups and lawmakers, many of which are increasingly fed up with what they say is China’s failure to live up to its World Trade Organization commitments.Some have expressed concerns that after nearly eight months of tit-for-tat tariffs roiling global financial markets, disrupting manufacturing supply chains, and shrinking U.S. farm exports, Trump could end up settling for a deal that increases commodity sales to Beijing while doing little to change China’s underlying trade practices and industrial policies.In his Feb. 5 State of the Union address, Trump said a China trade deal “must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.”But as the March 1 deadline drew closer, Trump has appeared increasingly eager to make a deal, causing concerns among trade watchers that he was eroding U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer’s leverage in the talks."

107,"‘Green Book’ Emerges Surprise Best Picture Winner At Oscars 2019, Halts ‘Roma’ Wave","Los Angeles: In a surprise win, Peter Farrelly’s biographical comedy-drama “Green Book”, received the Best Picture honour at the 91st Academy Awards upstaging award season favourite “Roma”.The film, featuring Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, was based on the real-life story of Dr Don Shirley, an African-American jazz pianist and composer, who embarks on a cross-country tour that necessitates hiring a white driver Tony Vallelonga(Mortensen) to assist him as a bodyguard while he travels through America’s racially-divided Southern states. “Green Book” stopped “Roma”, Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron’s black-and-white love letter to his childhood, from making a clean sweep at the Oscars where it had already won Best Cinematography, Best Director and Best Foreign Language Film trophies.Other films nominated in the category were “Black Panther”, “Vice”, “BlacKkKlansman”, “Bohemian Rhapsody”, “The Favourite” and “A Star Is Born”. Hollywood star Julia Roberts presented the top honour of the ceremony to the cast and crew of the film including director Farrelly, actors Mortensen, Ali and Linda Cardillini. “The whole story is about love. This is about loving each other despite our differences and finding out about the truth of who we are, we are the same people,” Farrelly said while accepting the award.He gave a shout out to Mortensen, saying, “We have no movie (without you). All these awards are because of Viggo and Mahershala and Linda but it all started with Viggo. I give you this my friend.” The director also thanked veteran filmmaker Steven Spielberg who had helped the film’s producers in getting a distributor. Producer Jim Burke said the team put their heart and soul in the film. “We made this film with love and we made it with tenderness. We made it with respect. It was all under the direction of Pete Farrelly,” he said.Apart from the biggest award of the night, “Green Book” also gave Ali his second best supporting Oscar win besides its win in the Best Original Screenplay category. “Green Book”, one of the most critically-acclaimed projects of the year, had a rough Oscar campaign, courtesy controversies involving Mortensen, Farrelly and the film’s writer Nick Vallelonga, son of real-life Tony Vallelonga. Mortensen, 60, had come under fire on social media for using the N-word during a panel discussion after the screening of the film, while Farrelly found himself embroiled in a controversy after an old report resurfaced where he admitted to flashing his privates as a joke.Following the revelation, the director had issued an apology. Even Vallelonga faced backlash when his old tweets resurfaced in which he claimed to have witnessed thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrate the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, which turned out to be a fake news.

113,It Was Difficult Track Even For A Player Like Dhoni: Glenn Maxwell,"Visakhapatnam: Mahendra Singh Dhoni once again drew flak for his slow strike-rate against Australia in the first T20 International but Glenn Maxwell feels that on a low and slow track, that was all the former India captain could have done.Dhoni managed 29 off 37 balls in India’s below-par 126 for 7 on a track where the ball was not coming onto the bat. To be fair to Dhoni, a clutch of wickets fell and he also had to stem the rot with Yuzvendra Chahal at the other end.“It (the slow strike rate) was probably fair enough. With the way the wicket was behaving, it was difficult to score for any batter, let alone a guy who is not known for his power-hitting in Chahal,” Maxwell said in Dhoni’s defence as his analogy of Chahal’s pyrotechnics invited a few chuckles.It was such a track where deliveries were keeping low and Dhoni could manage only one six.“MS is obviously a world-class finisher and even he was finding it hard to hit the middle of the bat. So, I think it was right of him to try and farm the strike. He hit a six in the last over and I think that showed how difficult it was,” Maxwell said.He lauded his bowlers for keeping Dhoni under tight leash.“If you are holding MS to one boundary in the last few overs, it’s a pretty good effort and also a sign of the conditions as well.”They had targeted leg-spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and debutant Mayank Markande and Maxwell said Bumrah and Krunal Pandya werre toughest to face in such conditions.“Bumrah and Krunal Pandya were the toughest guys to face on that wicket because they are capable of extracting a low sort of bounce and didn’t give you much width to work,” he said.He also hailed man of the match Nathan Coulter-Nile who returned with 3/26 and also took two catches including that of skipper Virat Kohli (24).“He (Coulter-Nile) was brilliant. It was probably a wicket that suited him, it was keeping low and he was bowling straight making it really hard to create angles,” Maxwell said."
114,"India Vs England Women’S 2nd ODI: Shikha Pandey, Jhulan Goswami Restrict England For 161","Mumbai: Pacers Shikha Pandey and Jhulan Goswami snapped four wickets each as India women bowled out England for a paltry 161 in the second One Day International here Monday. Shikha (4-18) and Jhulan (4-30) troubled the visitors with their fiery spells. The duo was well supported by spinner Poonam Yadav (2-28) as the visitors put a sub-par show after opting to bat at the Wankhede stadium. This was Shikha’s best performance in the 50-over format.Only Natalie Sciver (85), who hammered 12 fours and a six, put up a fight for England and was the last woman to be dismissed.Earlier, Amy Jones (3) became Shikha’s first victim. Sarah Taylor (1) too fell cheaply after she dragged onto her stumps off Jhulan, with the visitors teetering at 11/2. Jhulan also got the prized scalp of Heather Knight (2). But then Sciver and opener Tamsin Beaumont (20) tried to steady the ship with their 30-run fourth wicket stand.However, Deepti Sharma took a blinder to dismiss Tamsin off Shikha. After Tamsin mistimed the slog-sweep, Deepti ran towards the boundary from square-leg and took a diving catch leaving England reeling at 44-4. Then Sciver and Lauren Winfield (28) played with ease to stitch a 49-run stand for the fifth wicket. But after all the hard-work, Winfield threw her wicket away.Shikha, in her final over, struck twice, reducing England to 95/7. However, Sciver added 42 runs with Alex Hartley for the last wicket to ensure that the visitors crossed the 150-run mark."
115,Controversial Serena Williams Cartoon Didn’T Breach Press Standards,"Canberra; Australia’s media watchdog on Monday ruled that a widely criticised cartoon showing tennis legend Serena Williams jumping next to a broken racket and a pacifier which she had spat, did not breach press standards.The Australian Press Council ruled that the drawing, published by the Melbourne-based Herald Sun newspaper, was instead capturing Williams’ “on-court tantrum” at the 2018 US Open final “using satire, caricature, exaggeration and humour”, CNN reported.The cartoon by the daily’s award-winning cartoonist, Mark Knight, was published shortly after the bad-tempered final, in which Williams had a dispute with the umpire over his allegedly sexist treatment.The press watchdog received a number of complaints about the image, which drew international condemnation.The Press Council said the newspaper “was depicting the moment when, in a highly animated tantrum, Williams smashed a racquet and loudly abused the chair umpire, calling him a thief, a liar and threatening that he would never umpire her matches again”.“(The Herald Sun) said it wanted to capture the on-court tantrum of Williams using satire, caricature, exaggeration and humour, and the cartoon intended to depict her behaviour as childish by showing her spitting a pacifier out while she jumps up and down,” it added.The cartoon showed Williams with large, exaggerated lips and nose, while her opponent, Japan’s Naomi Osaka, is depicted as a skinny blonde woman, to whom the umpire is saying: “Can’t you just let her win?”When it was first published, the US-based National Association of Black Journalists said the cartoon was “repugnant on many levels”, CNN reported.At the time, Herald Sun editor Damon Johnston said the cartoon “had nothing to do with gender or race”."

117,Kepa Insists He Wasn’T Disobeying Sarri In EFL Cup Final Confusion,"London, February 25: Kepa Arrizabalaga insists he did not refuse to be taken off in Chelsea’s EFL Cup final defeat to Manchester City and says the incident was simply a misunderstanding.City won the trophy for the second year in a row after a 4-3 victory on penalties following a goalless 120 minutes at Wembley on Sunday.There were remarkable scenes in the closing stages of extra time when Kepa appeared to argue against Sarri’s decision to replace him with Willy Caballero, after Chelsea’s starting goalkeeper had been struggling with cramp.Sarri reacted furiously on the touchlines, but later blamed the incident on miscommunication and made it clear he would not punish the player.Kepa spoke to reporters after the match to say he felt the matter had got out of hand on social media and in television coverage, and stressed he was not trying to defy his head coach.“Well, first of all, I have to say it was misunderstood,” Kepa explained. “In no moment was it my intention to disobey, or anything like that with the boss.“It was two or three minutes of confusion until the medics got to the bench, and they explained everything well. This was nothing to do with the problems I had this week, with [my hamstring], it wasn’t that. And, well, it was misunderstood. Because he thought I couldn’t continue, and – fundamentally – I was trying to say that, physically, I was fine.“I know if you see it from outside, I don’t know how it went out, it is not the best image. I have spoken with the boss. I think it was misunderstood. I understand that on television, on social media, they’re talking about this but I am here to explain it, to say that it wasn’t my intention to go against the manager. We have spoken now, and I was only trying to say I’m fine. He thought I wasn’t fine. It was in tense moments, with a lot happening.“I thought the bench felt I couldn’t continue, because it was the second time I’d gone to ground. It was extra time. We’d run a lot, so [going to ground] was also a way of stopping the match. We’d had a few moments suffering, defending, so it was to stop the match and for the team to draw breath and not a moment where I was saying I couldn’t continue.“It wasn’t that I was refusing to be substituted, it was a way of trying to tell the bench that I was fine.”Kepa is eager for the incident not to become the main talking point of the final, in which he felt Chelsea competed well against the Premier League champions.“I don’t think it has to be the major act of this final,” he said. “I understand we played a good level against one of the best teams in the world. We were close to winning, obviously we’re sad that we didn’t, and I think the team needs to continue playing like this, because we’ve shown we can compete against the best teams. Among the negatives, we have to take the positives.”Kepa then released a statement via Twitter to underline his version of events, saying: “I regret how the end of the match has been portrayed. At no time has it been my intention to disobey the coach or any of his decisions.“I think everything has been misunderstood in the heat of the final part of a match for a title. The coach thought I was not in a position to play on and my intention was to express that I was in good condition to continue helping the team, while the docs that had treated me arrived at the bench to give the message.“I feel the image that has been portrayed was not my intention. I have full respect for the coach and his authority.”"
118,Mate X Availability In India Will Depend On 5G Network: Huawei,"Barcelona: Huawei Mobile Handset Division President Kevin Ho unveils Mate X 5G foldable phone at the Mobile World Congress 2019 in Barcelona, Spain on Feb 24, 2019. (Photo: IANS)Barcelona: Huawei Mobile Handset Division President Kevin Ho unveils Mate X 5G foldable phone at the Mobile World Congress 2019 in Barcelona, Spain on Feb 24, 2019. (Photo: IANS) By V.S. ChandrasekarBarcelona, Feb 25 (IANS) Dashing hopes of Indian consumers willing to acquire the just-released foldable phone from Huawei any time soon, the company says it is not planning to bring a 4G version of the Mate X shortly and that its availability will depend on the 5G network in the country.Although India is targeting 2020 for 5G roll-out, the country is yet to allocate 5G spectrum to operators even for 5G trial of use cases.Expensive at 2,299 euros (about Rs 1,85,000), the foldable Mate X is a 5G phone and as the US has been raising security concerns over use of Huawei 5G equipment, the European market could be the first to see the release of the phone.Huawei showcased the foldable phone at Mobile World Congress (MWC), Barcelona, on Sunday, but did not allow the visiting journalists to touch the device.”We expect to start shipping the device form the middle of this year through the carrier channel. Making the device available in the open market may take some time,” Kevin Ho, President of the Handset Business, Huawei Consumer Business Group, told IANS here.Replying to a question about producing foldable phone for the 4G network, he said that although the company was not focusing on bringing a 4G to suit markets like India, it could consider such a proposal at a later stage.Powered by the company’s Kirin 980 processor, the Huawei Mate X comes with a 6.6-inch dual display panel and offers a FullView display.It houses massive 4,500 mAH dual battery and several industry-first features, including a new superfast charging capability that can reach 85 per cent battery in just 30 minutes.The phone features a flexible OLED panel and a falcon wing mechanical hinge.”Creating the foldable phone’s hinge is the most challenging part for our engineers,” Ho said. “We had to design the hinge to avoid layers like formation that one gets when one folds a book or a notebook. This was a big challenge and they had to use a sophisticated technology,” he added.While Ho asserted that the phone was ready for mass production, he acknowledged that the company was still doing several tests and was also in talks with app developers so that apps can be optimised for a foldable device.The 8GB + 512 GB phone, which can be easily unfolded at the click of a button, now has only one colour, Interstellar Blue, and comes with a full protection case. Huawei said it might introduce new colours for the device at a later stage.When unfolded, the 6.6-inch dual display panel transforms into an 8-inch tablet only 5.4mm thick.While unveiling the device on Sunday at a packed hall here, Huawei Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu claimed that the phone offers best selfie camera. But the company did not reveal the camera specifications.”The phone will provide users more privacy and security protection,” he said.”Today, many carriers are using NSA (non-standalone) architecture, working together with 4G. But the future of 5G is SA (standalone) architecture.“Mate X is the only phone now with the capability to work in both the architecture. So this phone is not only for today, but also for future 5G,” Yu noted.Ho parried questions on security concerns raised by countries like the US which accuse Huawei of passing on data to the Chinese government.”We don’t want to talk about it today. We want to focus on technology and our new products today,” he said. (V.S. Chandrasekar can be reached at chandru.v@ians.in)–IANSvsc/na/ab(This story was auto-published from a syndicated feed.

119,"Ban On Unregulated Deposit Schemes Ordinance, 2019: What It Implies?","Last week, just few months ahead of the general assembly elections 2019, the government has put a ban on Unregulated Deposit Schemes Ordinance, 2019. The effect of the ban will be more pronounced given the timing of such an announcement and experts compare it to the November 2016 event of demonetisation which came in just 3 months prior to elections in Uttar Pradesh.Also, the move will protect investors who give in to different ponzi and chit fund schemes.Within the scope of the unregulated deposit scheme ordinance 2019, the ability to enhance financial resources to meet different social and personal commitments or different urgencies will see no extended resources as the law permits taking loans only from relatives. And the definition of relatives is limited up to only immediate family members.The law in this regard permits deposits from banks, financial institutions, property buyers, customers and for other purposes. Likewise, a proprietor can engage in borrowing activity from a non-relative so long the borrowing is for business dealings only.Also, it will prove to be a blow for the ailing real-estate sector, as developers or property sellers will only be able to accept deposits for a designated transaction and the amount can be adjusted against future sale consideration.The move in all is an attempt to safeguard gullible investors from yielding in to ponzi and pyramid schemes. Also, as the idea of the deposit means money received by way of loan or advance or in any other form by any deposit taker with a promise of returning either in cash or kind or as a specified service. So, the acceptance of unregulated deposits may provide a trigger to freezing and attachment of assets and also may result in imprisonment."

Polls suggest that without the alliance one or both of the far right parties might fail to reach the 3.25 percent threshold needed to win any seats in the 120-member parliament. With the merger they could win as many as five.Netanyahu has defended the merger as a way to improve his chances of forming a right-wing governing coalition led by his Likud Party, to serve for a fifth term after the April 9 vote.Such a bloc, he said, would best protect Israel`s security. But criticism levelled by AIPAC and another major U.S. Jewish group, the American Jewish Committee (AJC), against Jewish Power dominated coverage in Israel on Sunday of the closely-contested race.“AIPAC has a longstanding policy not to meet with members of this racist and reprehensible party,” the lobbying group said, echoing comments tweeted by the AJC.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=508353560&amp;adf=3268255070&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.9~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615632759&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fat-home-and-abroad-netanyahu-faces-backlash-for-far-right-alliance%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615632759966&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=1253&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D796c4db17f4993c7-225063d0dbc600b6%3AT%3D1615632745%3ART%3D1615632745%3AS%3DALNI_MZRTp0ckTgYrpMFgmzMKLADPDNhuw&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1034x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=710143303584&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=2112016820.1615632742&amp;ga_sid=1615632759&amp;ga_hid=967142561&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=4&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1956&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=21068083%2C31060304&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=2971280028382314&amp;pem=332&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;cms=2&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=RGha2RUsvL&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=34"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CKrr74aNre8CFZQC5wodjagBEQ"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
AIPAC has generally provided unflinching backing for Netanyahu`s policies during his 13 years in power, even as some U.S. Jewish organisations have expressed reservations over Israel`s lurch to the right.Netanyahu`s leading opponent, former armed forces chief Benny Gantz, a leader of the new centrist Blue and White alliance, said the prime minister had crossed an ethical line and was damaging “our important relationship with U.S. Jews”.On the heels of its criticism, AIPAC announced on Twitter on Sunday that Netanyahu has confirmed he will address its annual policy conference in Washington late next month.Jewish Power`s leaders have described themselves as successors to Kahane, a U.S.-born rabbi who served one term in parliament in the 1980s before his Kach party was banned by Israel as racist.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_4"" name=""aswift_4"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=508353560&amp;adf=3560378383&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.17~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615632760&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fat-home-and-abroad-netanyahu-faces-backlash-for-far-right-alliance%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615632759971&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=1258&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D796c4db17f4993c7-225063d0dbc600b6%3AT%3D1615632745%3ART%3D1615632745%3AS%3DALNI_MZRTp0ckTgYrpMFgmzMKLADPDNhuw&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1034x280%2C699x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=5&amp;correlator=710143303584&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=2112016820.1615632742&amp;ga_sid=1615632759&amp;ga_hid=967142561&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=4&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2332&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=21068083%2C31060304&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=2971280028382314&amp;pem=332&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;cms=2&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=5&amp;uci=a!5&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=ZlU0NMHpWW&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=586"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!5"" data-google-query-id=""CIqGkYeNre8CFRwQrQYdEEUPbA"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
Kahane, assassinated in New York in 1990 by an Egyptian-born American gunman, advocated the “transfer” of Palestinians to neighbouring Arab countries and a ban on intermarriage between Israeli Jews and Arabs.“We usually do not interfere in elections. However, in this case, our voice needs to be heard,” Avital Leibovich, director of the Jerusalem office of the American Jewish Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.Asked on Army Radio on Sunday about AIPAC`s criticism, Itamar Ben-Gvir, a Jewish Power leader, said: “They aren`t based here, they don`t see the terrorist attacks or experience firsthand the blood that is spilled here.”Jewish Power`s Baruch Marzel, who along with Ben-Gvir is a settler in the occupied West Bank, told Reuters the party gets “a lot of support from Jews and non-Jews” in the United States who believe God promised the biblical land of Israel to the Jewish people.Israel Hayom, a pro-Netanyahu newspaper, also condemned AIPAC, accusing it in a banner headline of “playing into the hands of media and politicians out to slam the right-wing”."

The PIL sought directions for the freezing of bank accounts of separatists. It contended that the separatists should be banned from contesting polls."

The former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir was reacting to media reports that the Election Commission of India will take a call on holding Assembly polls together with the Lok Sabha election after a visit to the state this week.Abdullah said except for an odd by-election, all elections in Jammu and Kashmir since 1995-96 have been held as per schedule.“Will PM Modi be able to keep to this schedule or will he accept he’s totally mishandled J&amp;K? The next few days will give us the answer,” he added."

Taking advantage of new time-of-flight depth sensor, combined with built-in Artificial Intelligene (AI) and semantic understanding, HoloLens 2 enables direct manipulation of holograms with the same instinctual interactions you would use with physical objects in the real world.“HoloLens 2 contains eye-tracking sensors that make interacting with holograms even more natural,” said the company.The new dial-in fit system makes the headset comfortable to wear for longer periods.In addition to HoloLens 2, Microsoft also announced Azure Kinect Developer Kit (DK) that combines industry-leading AI camera in a single device for developers.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=668433889&amp;adf=126931092&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.11~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615632784&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fmicrosoft-introduces-hololens-2-ai-camera-for-developers%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615632784589&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=1159&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D796c4db17f4993c7-225063d0dbc600b6%3AT%3D1615632745%3ART%3D1615632745%3AS%3DALNI_MZRTp0ckTgYrpMFgmzMKLADPDNhuw&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=6524934851680&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=2112016820.1615632742&amp;ga_sid=1615632784&amp;ga_hid=357525419&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=7&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1885&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=21068083%2C21065724&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=3498613291522990&amp;pem=332&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=wBEIOvfeYi&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=35"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CKHG0ZKNre8CFdDU3god-84LFw"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>

Pakistan has also been blasted by its neighbours time and again for maintaining good relations with their enemy states and non-state actors. While it is China in case of India, it is Saudi Arabia in case of Iran and the Taliban in case of Afghanistan’s elected government.Recently, while India was left frustrated over its failure to get the UN declare JeM chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist because of China’s blockade, Iran too was displeased with the way Pakistan’s Imran Khan government has been found handling the Saudis.The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), recently visited Pakistan and pledged a massive investment there. He was driven from the airport personally by PM Khan and MBS later showered praise on the host country. Understandably, it did not go down well with Iran, a major enemy of the Saudis in West Asia.Imran Khan govt disappoints IranA piece in Tehran Times titled ‘Pakistan a pawn in Saudi’s sinister game’ hit out at the Khan government saying it eventually did not honour the words it had uttered in having a balanced relation with both Saudi and Iran, two of its close allies, and “followed the same beaten track”. It said PM Khan secretly approached the International Monetary Fund for a bailout and sought financial help from countries like China and Saudi Arabia.“…Saudis doling out money to Pakistan was interesting. They saw an opportunity beckoning them and they grabbed it with both hands. Without knowing, the new Pakistan government had traded its sovereignty for Saudi petro dollars,” the piece said.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
Pakistan PM eats sitting with Saudi crown prince; president asked to stand up and deliver speechIt also accused Khan of keeping alive the tradition of earlier Pakistan prime ministers who had a clear inclination to the Saudis despite promising a change in the approach of “Naya Pakistan” of his era. It said in response to Khan’s high praises for Saudi Arabia as one which “always stood with Pakistan in difficult times”, Riyadh announced financial support worth $6 billion to Islamabad.“Those who were expecting a nuanced and balanced approach to Islamabad’s relations with Tehran and Riyadh under Imran Khan were left disillusioned,” the Iranian newspaper article said.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
It said Saudi Arabia’s financial backing to Pakistan had less to do with its friendship and more about promoting its “own sinister agendas” like outsourcing of the Wahhabi ideology and sponsoring extremist ideologies in other nations affiliated to the same ideology. It said the Saudi’s effort had to be seen against the backdrop of its rivalry with Iran and its quest in destabilising Tehran."

But the government should not forget that China is with them (Pakistan). We feel that the government should have a long term strategy to safeguard our borders and make the country strong. If long term strategy won’t be adopted then you can’t defeat Pakistan.’Talking about Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman recent visit to India, Akhilesh said, ‘Recently media showed how a Crown Prince first visited Pakistan and helped them. Then he came to India and hugged Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Later he went to China. In today’s times, the role of neighbouring countries matters… BJP leaders are the most ‘milawati’.’Akhilesh also urged the central government to give Rs 1 crore to the families of all the CRPF jawans, who lost their lives in the Pulwama terror attack.‘The government should fulfill its promises given to the jawans.

131,"Himachal Avalanche: Rescue Ops For 5 Missing Jawans Resumes; Slim Chances Of Survival, Say Officials","A day after snowfall halted the search operation for five troopers, who went missing last week after an avalanche hit Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh, the operation began again on Monday, officials said.“The rescue operation started at 7 am More engineering efforts like chain saws and drill machines have been deployed to enhance the operation,” an official, who is coordinating the operation, told IANS.The search was halted on Sunday due to intermittent snowfall throughout the day. No clues were found till then.As the search operation entered the sixth day on Monday, officials said chances of survival of those trapped in the snow were slim.Officials said a lot of snow had accumulated at the avalanche site, 350 km from the state capital, and fresh snow has made treks treacherous. The snow has solidified into hard rocks, making it difficult to dig, they said.Many mountaineers from the area are also involved in the operation.The February 20 avalanche was triggered by the sliding of a glacier near Namgia Dogri, bordering Tibet, burying six Jammu and Kashmir Rifles troopers.One of the trapped soldiers, Rakesh Kumar (41), was pulled out the same day but his life could not be saved. His body was airlifted to his native place Ghumarpur village in Bilaspur district today.The state government said two separate parties of the Army and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) were patrolling Namgia Dogri when the avalanche hit.Five ITBP troopers were also injured in the disaster.Blizzards, high-speed winds, fresh snowfall and poor visibility had been severely hampering the rescue operations, an Indian Army spokesperson said.Lt Gen PM Bali, Chief of Staff of Western Command headquarters, visited the site of the avalanche on February 23 and assured that all out efforts were underway for searching the missing Army men.Stepping up rescue operations, the Army deployed around 200 people that also include personnel from Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and Border Roads Organisation (BRO).The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted more snowfall in the region on February 26-27, and thereafter on March 1-2."

133,Sri Lanka: Mute Beggar On Bus Suddenly Starts Talking,"Colombo, Feb 25: Some stories are so baffling that it becomes difficult sometime to differentiate them from an entertaining joke cracked by a person of humour.Recently, an instance happened at a bus station in Sri Lanka and it left people in splits after it was shared on a news platform. It was at the Central Bus Stand in Pettah, Colombo, Sri Lanka, where a lot of beggars seek help in large numbers.One among those beggars was known to be mute and he used his hands to communicate with people while seeking help. It was mainly in the evening time that the person was spotted begging in the buses.China: Railway station asks travellers not to give money to ‘rich’ beggarAccording to a report in Sri Lanka’s Daily Mirror, a passenger saw the beggar boarding a bus with a pair of crutches for his everyday business of seeking help.The passenger first thought that the mute person might have met with an accident that forced him to use the support. But just when he took out a note to give the beggar out of sympathy, the latter, to his surprise, started talking! He said: “Look at what happened to me…”The passenger quietly put the note back into his pocket even as the beggar went on convincing other people travelling in the bus."
134,GST Rates Slashed On Under-Construction Properties,"The GST Council meet on Sunday has reduced the GST rates on under-construction properties from April 1. For properties priced above Rs. 45 lakh, the GST rates are now kept at 5% in comparison to 12% currently. Also, in case of affordable housing, the rates have been reduced to far below than what was proposed to 1% from 8% currently. For the new structures, the real estate developer will not be able to make a claim for input tax credit or ITC.Jaitley post the meet said the decision could help in the realization of the mission of housing for all in the next 3 years time.“This move will give fillip to apartments under construction in the country, and improve the flow of credit to the real estate sector,” he said. Affordable houses in metro cities would be 2 BHK flats, while those in non-metros would be close to 3 BHK apartments, Jaitley said.Further in regards to the scope of affordable housing, the Council included a twin definition based on cost and carpet area. In metro cities, affordable house will be defined as a house with carpet area of up to 60 sq. m and priced less than Rs 45 lakh. In non-metros, a bigger flat of up to 90 sq. m would be considered affordable housing, with the cost cap unchanged at Rs 45 lakh.“Affordable housing has been defined in a very liberal manner. About 95 per cent of flats in small cities and about a third in metros are affordable houses. So, the aspirational class in smaller Indian cities would now pay only 1 per cent GST on under-construction flats they buy,” said a senior finance ministry official.Metro cities would include the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, National Capital Region (Delhi), Bengaluru, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Chennai.Nonetheless it is being perceived that the removal of input tax credit from the system is likely to result in an increase in cost of houses due to GST burden on developers."

India said Khan’s offer to investigate the attack if provided proof is a “lame excuse”.“It is a well-known fact that Jaish-e-Mohammed and its leader Masood Azhar are based in Pakistan. These should be sufficient proof for Pakistan to take action,” the Ministry of External Affairs said."
136,Microsoft Will End Windows 7 Support In July,"Microsoft has confirmed to end the support for Windows 7 OS by 2020. However, if users of the OS do not install the update that will be rolled out in March, the support will come to an end in July 2019 itself.Well, Microsoft rolls out updates leveraging the SHA-1 or SHA-2 encryption algorithm for security purposes. As per PCWorld, the company is all set to completely phase out the support for the former in the upcoming security update. This update will mark the shift to leverage more reliable encryption algorithm and will be released on March 12.The report cites the company mentioning that the security algorithm SHA-1 has become less secure over time. This is mainly because of the weakness that is found in the security algorithm, advent of cloud computing and increased processor performance. There are stronger alternatives like the SHA-2 algorithm, which is preferred as it does not have such issues.The report goes on stating that it is for this reason that Microsoft will rollout the Windows 7 security updates using the security algorithm SHA-2 in July. Windows 7 users are recommended to install the update to be rolled out on March 12 to get the SHA-2 support. Those users who fail to install the update will face discontinuation of the OS support soon.In addition to this, Microsoft is also in plans to update a few dated versions of the WSUS (Windows Server Update Services). Notably, Windows 10 is available on 39.22% devices while the dated Windows 7 runs on 36.9% devices as of 2018, as per a report by Net MarketShare. Customers using the legacy OS versions such as Windows 7 SP1, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and Windows Service 2008 SP2 are required to receive the SHA-2 support on their devices by this July. Devices without this support will not be provided Windows updates after the stipulated time."

138,She Doesn’T Want To Work Again With Priya,"Malayalam movie ‘Oru Adaar Love’ is made in the combination of Roshan-Noorin-Priya. While making this movie, director highlighted Roshan and Noorin and showed Priya Prakash as a side character. However, Priya Prakash with her wink and gun shot suddenly became a nation-wide celebrity. As a result ‘Oru Adaar Love’ director taking into account Priya’s popularity changed the film’s story and made Priya Prakash the main lead. This was understood by everyone who watched the movie. When the film was released many said the film has Noorin in the side role while the main character is that of Priya Prakash.Now Noorin is also saying the same. In Telugu ‘Oru Adaar Love’ was released on Valentine’s Day and proved an utter flop. When people were forgetting this movie, Noorin who acted in it said when the film shooting began she was taken as the heroine but with Priya Prakash suddenly becoming popular her role was cut and Priya Prakash’s role was highlighted. Noorin regretted that because of Priya her role changed from heroine to a supporting one.Unhappy over the way she was treated, Noorin has said that if she gets a chance to work with Priya Prakash she will do her best not to accept it. Heartburn for poor Noorin. She also said that if she gets a chance to work with hero Roshan she will not let it go. ‘Oru Adaar Love’ director though the film will run with the craze for Priya but made a rubbish film and dumped it on audience. Audiences are not fools. That’s why they rejected it."

But at the same time, I am proud of Mithai, even when I would have given few hits down the line, when I get old as well I will be proud of Mithai.From the beginning, I used to tell my crew if its hit we will have success party if it bombs we will have failure party. The cast has slowly started to dissociate themselves, which is pretty much understandable if a film is a hit 100 people come to take credit. If it bombs director is the lonely man standing I am not lonely my cameraman Ravivarman Neelamegam, my sound designer Sachin Sudhakaranand my music director Vivek Sagarand the direction department are standing with me.

145,"I Am In Good Place Now, Says Fit-Again Uthappa","Fit-again Kolkata Knight Riders batsman Robin Uthappa, who is back in action after recovering from an ankle surgery, said “he is in a good place” at the moment after taking part in a Syed Mushtaq Ali domestic T20 game.The 33-year-old, who now plays for Saurashtra, scored 46 against Railways on Thursday.“I am in a good place right now. Honestly, it has been a learning curve for me – going through the injury, and then the surgery,” Uthappa was quoted as saying by the KKR website.Uthappa had an ankle surgery that kept him out of action for four months. He went under the knife in London last October.He spent almost a month at the KKR Academy and recovered under the watchful eyes of Abhishek Nayar, the head coach and mentor at the Academy.The nature of his injury was called Osteophytes, where a particular bone or joint goes through some stress. It causes additional growth as the bone naturally calcifies itself to bridge the gaps.“It was impeding the flexibility and movement around my ankle, and I have had it for the last three or four years.“Immediately after the surgery, the range of movements around my ankle was almost twice as much as (it was) before the surgery happened. So I am really happy to get it out of the way. I am happy to be back to playing cricket,” said the former India international.“As I spent more time in the middle, I actually felt that I have gotten better, better and better,” Uthappa said."
146,Lanka Script History In South Africa,"Oshada Fernando and Kusal Mendis propelled Sri Lanka to an eight-wicket win over South Africa on the third day of the second Test at St George’s Park on Saturday, clinching a historic 2-0 series triumph.The unheralded Sri Lankans became the first team from Asia to win a Test series in South Africa.Unlike their dramatic, unexpected one-wicket win in the first Test in Durban, the Sri Lankans surged to victory as Fernando and Mendis shared an unbeaten 163-run third wicket partnership studded with crisp, authoritative strokes.Fernando made 75 not out off 106 balls and Mendis scored 84 not out off 110 deliveries as Sri Lanka chased down a victory target of 197, reaching the mark by lunch.Resuming at 60 for two, Fernando and Mendis batted positively from the start of play, scoring nine runs off the second over of the day, bowled by Kagiso Rabada.No South African bowler was able to settle into a consistent rhythm.Dale Steyn was brought into the attack after 36 runs had been scored off the first eight overs of the morning. Mendis struck three boundaries in the first over from South Africa’s all-time leading wicket-taker.Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj extracted some sharp turn from a pitch which otherwise offered nothing to the bowlers despite the extraordinary events of the first two days when 31 wickets fell.But the batsmen used their feet against Maharaj who conceded 23 runs off four overs, including a straight six by Fernando, before being taken off.Mendis was dropped on 70 when a leaping Hashim Amla at first slip could only get his fingertips to a slash against Duanne Olivier. By then, though, only 31 runs were needed.Sri Lanka’s series win was one of the biggest upsets in recent cricket history.South Africa had won their previous seven series at home and had won 16 out of 19 home Tests, with only two defeats, before losing in Durban.Sri Lanka, by contrast, had lost six and drawn one of their previous seven Tests before arriving in South Africa with their team seemingly in disarray.The selectors had made wholesale changes, including the dropping of captain Dinesh Chandimal, several players were missing because of injuries, while coach Chandika Hathurusingha was stripped of some of his powers.Yet the Sri Lankans heeded the call of Dimuth Karunaratne, who was announced as ‘interim’ captain, to “compete in every session” and to play with a smile on their faces.The win in the second Test was set up by the Sri Lankan bowlers after South Africa led by 68 runs on the first innings.Despite the absence of injured left-arm spinner Lasith Embuldeniya, South Africa were bowled out for 138, leaving Sri Lanka with a target which Fernando and Mendis made to appear easy."
147,We Respect Government’S Decision: Kohli,"India captain Virat Kohli on Saturday said that his team will “respect the decision of the government” with regards to playing Pakistan in the upcoming World Cup in the wake of the Pulwama terror attacks.There have been calls to boycott the June 16 World Cup face-off against Pakistan at the Old Trafford in the aftermath of the dastardly attack but the Indian cricket board has not taken a call, putting the ball in government’s court.“Our stand is simple. We stick by what the nation wants to do and what the BCCI decides to do and that is basically our opinion,” skipper Kohli said on the eve of India’s opening T20I against Australia on Sunday.“Whatever the government and the board decide, we will eventually go by that and will respect that,” Kohli added.The captain offered his condolences on behalf of the entire Indian team to the families of the martyred soldiers.“Our sincere condolences to the families of the soldiers who lost their lives. The Indian team is really shocked and sad about what happened.”Kohli’s stand is pretty similar to what chief coach Ravi Shastri echoed in an interview to a television channel where he said that the team will “accept whatever decision that the government takes.”“It’s entirely left to the BCCI and the government. They know exactly what is happening and they will take a call. We will go by what they decide,” Shastri had said.“If the government says it’s that sensitive and we do not need to play the World Cup, I will go by my government,” the head coach further said.On Friday, the Committee of Administrators run BCCI decided against taking any stand on the World Cup clash against Pakistan but urged the ICC and other nations to “sever ties” with countries from where “terrorism emanates”.“The 16th of June is very far away. We will take a call on that much later and in consultation with the government,” CoA chief Vinod Rai had said on Friday“We must sever ties with nations from which such terrorism emanates. We will express our concern on an appropriate forum,” Rai had further added.There has been divided opinion among cricket fraternity with Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar urging India to play and beat Pakistan denying them any leeway in the tournament.However, there are counter-views with another former skipper Sourav Ganguly and Harbhajan Singh calling for a boycott of sporting ties with the neighbouring country."
148,"India Vs Australia: Perfect Opportunity For Youngsters To Seal World Cup Spots, Says Aussie Skipper Aaron Finch","Australian captain Aaron Finch on Saturday said the limited overs series against India would give the youngsters a perfect opportunity to stake a claim for two World Cup spots with the suspended duo of Steve Smith and David Warner racing against time to recover from injuries.The duo suffered similar elbow injuries while playing in the Bangladesh Premier League last month. Both had to undergo surgeries and it’s not clear whether they would be fit in time for the World Cup beginning May 30.“Definitely it’s a great opportunity for the guys to come in and really challenge for that spot. David (Warner) obviously had some elbow surgery recently so that’ll be in the back of the mind as well,” Finch said on the eve of the opening T20 against India here.“But if things don’t go 100 per cent right with their rehab or some complications with it and they’re not back in time, it’s a huge, huge opportunity for guys to step up and almost cement their place going forward.” The Aussies are fresh from playing in the Big Bash League where top-order batsman D’Arcy Short bagged the player of the tournament award and became the first player to score 600-plus runs.“With the two T20 matches (against India), it’s a chance for the guys to continue on their Big Bash form and test themselves against the best in the world in their own conditions.” Five ODIs against India will follow the two-match T20 series.“We still got 10 Internationals plus five other practice warm-up games before that first World Cup game so there’s still a fair bit of cricket to go and as long as we keep tracking in the right direction and give India a really good fight and win the series that will be what is all about.” The recent T20 form of vice-captain Alex Carey and all-rounder Marcus Stoinis also augurs well for the Australian team.“There’s also things you can juggle around in one day cricket a bit for a little bit. So whatever we feel is a combination at the time I don’t think anything is out of question.”Asked about their opening combination, he said: “Again in the ODI side Short is there. He’s been exceptional and he’s open the batting. He’s obviously prolific in the middle order. Usman, myself, Alex. So there’s still a few options.”After a miserable run of form this year, Australia are determined the players’ key focus is on defending their one-day title ahead of the gruelling Ashes.To manage the workload, the Australian top players won’t be available for the last few weeks of the lucrative Indian Premier League that will run from March 23-May 13.“I know there will be guys who will be here for the first half of the IPL and then be home by the start of May. So IPL will be really a crucial period for guys to be able to take that time off and get away from cricket and mentally recharge.”Finch also spoke highly of Stoinis who excelled for BBL runners-up Melbourne Stars scoring 533 runs at 53.30 and claiming 14 wickets to cap off a season where he was named the Australian male ODI player of the year.“Yeah absolutely he’s someone who can bowl 10 overs, bowl four overs in T20 cricket. He can be at the top of the order he can be really successful in the middle order as well.“To have someone who’s as flexible as that is a great asset in your team because then you can build a team around them and that can fill any hole that you need. If there’s a weakness somewhere he’s generally the best person to fix it and you can shuffle it around them,” he added."
149,Share Pledging Rises Across Sectors: All`s Well With Corporate India?,"Busting the notion that share pledging by promoters is on the rise in sectors such as energy and infrastructure where incidence of stressed assets is climbing, owners of companies across sectors, some relatively financially healthy ones, are using pledging to meet their urgent fund requirements.According to a report by Kotak Institutional Equities, promoters of a total of 116 companies, or one-fifth of BSE-500 entities, pledged their holdings by December last year. Though the numbers increased over the quarter ended in September only marginally from 114 then, the growth trajectory has been consistent in indicating that not all is well in the corporate circles and earnings are yet to reach stable levels. The list of 116 includes companies across sectors including Indiabulls Real Estate, Coffee Day Enterprises, Jain Irrigation Systems, Infibeam Avenues and Jindal Steel &amp; Power. These entities saw highest surge in the pledged promoter holdings in the December 2018 quarter. Others like Texmaco Rail, Uflex and Wockhardt pledged their shares for the first time.While promoters increased the quantum of pledged shares from 40 to 61 per cent between September and December period last year, a growth of over 21 per cent, Coffee Day saw pledging increasing from 59.7 per cent to 79.4 during the same period. Jindal Steel &amp; Power also pledged 50.2 per cent of promoters holding with banks and financial institutions.“The pledging has picked up post-2014, after Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) became a lot more aggressive in lending to promoters. This arrangement worked well till 2017 when the mid-cap and the small-cap shares were having a positive run. Tables turned only after the mid-cap and small-cap stocks started correcting due to the weak sentiments hitting this section of the market. This has made companies with high levels of pledged share riskier for investors,” said Mayuresh Joshi of Angel Broking.A case in point here are companies such as CG Power and Industrial, Kwality, IL&amp;FS Transportation Networks, Hindustan Construction Co, Jindal Stainless Hissar and Sterlite Technologies where promoters have pledged more than 90 per cent of their holdings to raise funding support.According to Kotak Equities, the percentage of pledged promoter holdings stood at 6.7 per cent in the December quarter similar to that of September 2018. But outstanding promoters’ pledged shares were at a high of Rs 1.96 lakh crore, which is about 1.47 per cent of the total BSE-500 Index’s market capitalization in December 2018.But the Kotak report has also clarified that pledging of shares does not necessarily imply that a company or a promoter is under financial stress; banks (lenders) could have sought additional security in the form of promoter shares.While increasing number of promoters are raising pledging, a chunk of companies have also bucked the trend and actually paid banks to free up shares. Kotak report said that promoter holdings declined in companies such as Fortis Healthcare, Suzlon Energy, Advanced Enzyme Technologies, Adani Transmission and Indiabulls Housing Finance in the December quarter."
150,Vistara-Japan Airlines Enter Into Codeshare Partnership,"Full-service domestic carrier Vistara and Japan Airlines (JAL) on Friday entered into a codeshare partnership intended to open more routes between India and Tokyo.A codeshare agreement allows two airlines to sell seats on each others’ flights in order to provide passengers with a wider choice of destinations.The two airlines already have an interline or through check-in partnership and have also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in September 2017 to pursue commercial opportunities together. “With the signing of this agreement, Vistara becomes the only codeshare partner for Japan Airlines in India. The sale of tickets open on 26 February 2019 on all channels and major GDS systems, for travel from 28 February 2019,” the full-service domestic carrier said in a statement. The codeshare flights are expected to provide convenient connections to and from a daily flight that JAL already operates to Delhi directly from Tokyo’s Narita airport. "
151,Protest Forces Karachi Bakery In Bengaluru To Cover Up Signboard,"New Delhi: A Karachi Bakery outlet in Bengaluru was on Friday forced to cover up the word ‘Karachi’ in its signboard after a mob of 20-25 people protested against the reference to the city in Pakistan, from which it takes its name.The mob assembled near the bakery’s outlet in Indiranagar, demanding that its name be changed. The development comes a week after the deadly Pulwama attack in Kashmir, where more than 40 CRPF personnel were killed in a suicide attack. A cine workers association has banned all artists from Pakistan, while the BCCI has sought to sever sporting ties with the country .The mob refused to disperse from the bakery and continued to protest from 8 pm to 8:30 pm. To placate the crowd, the establishment covered up the word ‘Karachi’ in its signboard and put up an Indian flag. There was no property damage or violence at the site.The branch’s manager told The News Minute that men who were part of the mob claimed to ‘know people in the army’. ‘They thought we are from Pakistan. But we have been using this name for the last 53 years. The owners are Hindus; only the name is Karachi bakery. To satisfy them, we put up the Indian flag,’ the manager said.The Karachi Bakery was started in Hyderabad in 1953 by Khanchand Ramnani, who migrated from Karachi during the Partition. It has since grown into a nationwide franchise.Despite the protest, the bakery continued to operate till its scheduled closing time of 11 pm.Since the Pulwama attack, there have been reports of attacks against Kashmiris in other parts of India. The Supreme Court has asked the Centre to take steps to protect Kashmiris. The Centre has asked the states to take steps to ensure the safety of Kashmiris."
152,Telcos With 4G Network Will Have To Invest Less For 5G Services: TRAI,"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) in a white paper released on Friday said although deployment of the 5G network would require substantial investments, the operators which currently have 4G network would need a lesser amount of investment as they can use their existing 4G infrastructure for 5G services.The white paper named ‘Enabling 5G in India’ said new operators would require large investments.“Deployment of 5G network will require substantial investment in the core, Radio Network and Spectrum. However, the 5G services will open up many new revenue streams also as it will cater to variety of solutions to new verticals besides enhanced mobile broadband solutions,” it said.“Operators with existing 4G footprints will be able to leverage their 4G infrastructure for providing 5G services and hence their investment requirement will be relatively less. Whereas a greenfield operator will need to establish the network from ground level and therefore would require huge amount of investments,” TRAI said.The three incumbent major operators – Jio, Vodafone Idea and Airtel – have their 4G infrastructure and network ready and the investment may not be huge for them.Referring to an estimate by Nokia, TRAI said that 5G coverage compared to 4G coverage using 1800 MHz (megahertz) spectrum band would be about 60 per cent. Operators with existing 5G footprints will be able to leverage 4G unified license (UL) coverage through the concept of dual connectivity or UL-sharing and hence will be able to cover larger areas with the same number of sites. A greenfield 5G operator will need to deploy about 66 per cent more sites to compensate for penetration losses. On the spectrum band for 5G, TRAI said: “Spectrum requirement for 5G network lies around three key frequencies ranges: Sub-1 GHz (gigahertz), 1-6 GHz and above 6 GHz. The choice of spectrum among these ranges will depend on the capacity and coverage requirement of the region.”“The 3.5 GHz spectrum band is likely to be the first band to be globally used for 5G deployment. The Department of Telecom (DoT) is yet to auction spectrum in the 3300-3600 MHz bands. Therefore, the telecommunications service providers (TSPs) are likely to incur initially an additional investment while launching 5G services on account of spectrum cost,” said the White Paper."
153,"Centre Announces Contest For Naming Bullet Train, Designing Mascot","NEW DELHI: The Centre has announced a contest inviting suggestions from Indian citizens for a suitable name and mascot design for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed bullet train.Announcing the contest, the National High-Speed Rail Corporation Ltd (NHSRCL) has revealed that participants can submit entries till March 25.In order to encourage people’s participation, an online competition has been organised on www.mygov.in where participants can submit their entries till 25th March 2019, it said.At the end of the contest, the name of the train and the mascot will be shortlisted through a nominated committee and winners will be awarded a cash prize along with a certificate confirming their participation in the contest.There will be five consolation prizes also in each category whose entries will be as good as winning entry but could not win because of certain minor details, the NHSRCL said in an official release.“The mascot essentially should be a well designed character which will personify the value system of NHSRCL and will also be able to communicate effectively. Naming the bullet train will provide it an identity which will help people to establish a connect with the bullet train,” it added.The bullet train between Ahmedabad and Mumbai will run a total length of 508 km, of which 21 km will be covered in the tunnel under the sea.The cost of the tunnel is estimated at Rs 3,500 crores.The total cost of the train project is Rs 1.10 trillion, and Japan is giving a loan of Rs. 88,000 crores for the same at a minimal interest of 0.1 per cent, which has to be repaid over 50 years."
154,New Rapid Test For Sepsis May Help Save Thousands Of Lives,"Researchers have developed an innovative, low cost test for earlier diagnosis of sepsis which could help save thousands of lives.The simple system for sensitive real-time measurement of the life threatening condition is much quicker than existing hospital tests, which can take up to 72 hours to process, said researchers from the University of Strathclyde in the UK.Using a microelectrode, a biosensor device is used to detect if one of the protein biomarkers of sepsis – interleukin-6 – is present in the bloodstream, they said.IL-6 is a molecule secreted by the immune system and the levels of it in the blood increase in many of those who have the condition.The results of the research project show that increased levels of the molecule can be detected by the test as quickly as two and a half minutes, researchers said.The small size of the devices — microelectrodes on a needle shaped substrates — makes them ideal for initial testing and also continuous monitoring for sepsis, which is notoriously difficult to diagnose.“The research shows that the tools we have developed could underpin a rapid test for sepsis,” said Damion Corrigan from the University of Strathclyde.“We have developed a needle shaped sensor with different electrodes and have shown we can detect one sepsis biomarker in almost real time, at the clinically relevant levels,” Corrigan said.“When levels go up, as they do in sepsis, we can detect that too. Sepsis is quite complex and difficult to diagnose but IL-6 is one of the best markers,” said Corrigan.“Our research so far shows you can measure a single sepsis marker, but there are actually eight sensors on the needle, each about the same diameter as a human hair and the idea is that in the future we can get multiple markers on the one microchip for a more comprehensive test,” he said.The device takes a pin prick of blood which is then put on the chip for the result to be read. Its needle shape means it can also be implanted and used on patients in intensive care.The UK Sepsis Trust estimates that around 52,000 people in the UK die every year and six million globally from the condition, yet with early diagnosis and the correct treatment, most people make a full recovery.Sepsis develops when the chemicals the immune system releases into the bloodstream to fight an infection instead cause inflammation throughout the entire body.Without quick treatment, it can lead to multiple organ failure and death. A delay of just one hour for giving the correct antibiotic can mean an increase in the likelihood of death.It is usually diagnosed based on simple measurements such as body temperature, heart rate and breathing rate, with patients often giving a blood test.There is a reliance on clinical judgement and hospital laboratory techniques to diagnose the condition can take up to 72 hours to provide a result.Researchers at the University of Leeds made the sensing element using microfabrication, while the Strathclyde team did all the measurements and developed the test using the sensor.At the moment the 72 hour blood test is a very labour intensive process because the doctor orders the test on a computer with samples going to a central laboratory for processing and return of the result,” Corrigan added.“The type of test we envisage could for example be at the bedside and involve doctors or nurses being able to monitor levels of sepsis biomarkers for themselves,” he said."
155,"Mehbooba, Sajjad Lone Question Jamaat-E-Islami Raids","Srinagar, Feb 23 (IANS) Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti and Peoples Conference (PC) chief Sajjad Lone on Saturday questioned the wisdom behind the detention of dozens of Jamaat-e-Islami cadres.Reacting to the overnight raids across the valley in which dozens of group’s leaders were detained, Mufti tweeted: “In the past 24 hours, Hurriyat leaders and workers of Jamaat organisation have been arrested.”Fail to understand such an arbitrary move which will only precipitate matters… Under what legal grounds are their arrests justified? You can imprison a person but not his ideas.”Lone, former state minister, also questioned: “Government seems to be on an arrest spree. Just a word of caution. Large scale arrests took place in 1990.” “Leaders were ferried to Jodhpur and many jails across the country. Things worsened. This is a tried tested and failed model.Please desist from it. It won’t work. Things will worsen,” Lone said in his reaction to the detentions.The raids were carried out during the night in south, central and north Kashmir areas in which dozens of Jamaat leaders, including its chief Abdul Hamid Fayaz, were detained.Yasin Malik, chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) was also taken into custody and lodged in a police station on Friday."
156,Amid Major Crackdown Centre Rushed 100 Companies Of Troops To J&K,"Srinagar, Feb 23: The Centre has rushed 100 companies of Paramilitary Forces to Kashmir on an urgent basis. The move comes just eight days after 40 CRPF jawans were martyred in a terror attack at Pulwama.The Ministry for Home Affairs ordered for the additional deployment of 100 companies of paramilitary forces that comprise 45 companies of the CRPF, 35 from BSF and 10 each from the ITBP and SSB.The move comes amidst a major crackdown n the Valley where raids were conducted on separatist leaders. The forces also arrested JKLF chief, Yasin Malik on Friday night. Several others including the chief of the Jamaat-e-Islami Abdul Hamid Fayaz were arrested.J&amp;K: Two terrorists killed in Baramulla encounter, arms and ammunition recoveredPolice officials said that this was a move aimed at preparing for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. The security has been tightened also in the wake of a crucial hearing on Article 35-A in the Supreme Court. The matter is likely to come up on Monday. The article grants special rights and privileges to the residents of Jammu and Kashmir.Following the Pulwama attack, the government had also withdrawn the security cover of several separatists in the Valley."

“The members of the Security Council underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice, and urged all States…to cooperate actively with the Government of India and all other relevant authorities in this regard,” it said.In his letter, Qureshi also accused the Indian government of using “water as a weapon”.“The long-standing legal arrangements agreed under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) are thus being imperilled,” he said.India has decided to “stop” the flow of its share of water to Pakistan from rivers under the Indus Water Treaty.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_4"" name=""aswift_4"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=2023535779&amp;adf=177258379&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.17~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615633200&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fpak-to-unsc-india-threatening-regional-security%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615633200340&amp;bpp=2&amp;bdt=898&amp;idt=2&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3De675d0cc1a65511d-225c2933d9c6003c%3AT%3D1615633139%3ART%3D1615633139%3AS%3DALNI_MauLx2yJ81LwaKeK23skYu7SxMAVQ&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280%2C699x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=5&amp;correlator=6991422599510&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1226660422.1615633135&amp;ga_sid=1615633200&amp;ga_hid=1071049695&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=10&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2311&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=21066108%2C21066110%2C42530671%2C21068083&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=4152287869195387&amp;pem=466&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=5&amp;uci=a!5&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=AE6sTsO0Mq&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=657"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!5"" data-google-query-id=""CI3dntmOre8CFSUE0wod-JEPnA"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
The reiteration to stop the flow of Indus water to Pakistan comes amid mounting Indo-Pak tension over the Pulwama terror strike that has triggered demands for action against the neighbouring country. India has already decided to revoke the Most Favoured Nation status to Pakistan and mounted a diplomatic offensive to isolate it in the international community.Qureshi said Pakistan has offered to cooperate with India if it shares any proof of involvement of Pakistani elements in the Pulwama attack.“Pakistan has offered its cooperation, if tangible evidence emerging from credible investigation is shared,” he wrote.India on Tuesday had said, “Disclaiming any link between the terrorist attack and Pakistan is an oft-repeated excuse by Pakistan.”“It is a well-known fact that Jaish-e-Mohammad and its leader Masood Azhar are based in Pakistan. These should be sufficient proof for Pakistan to take action,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.Qureshi said India “must refrain from escalating the situation and enter into dialogue with Pakistan” to ensure continued peace and stability in South Asia."

Craft is Trump’s second choice to replace Haley. His first choice, former State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, withdrew her name from consideration on February 16, citing personal and family reasons. Craft has been ambassador to Canada since October 2017. She previously served as an alternate delegate to the UN during the George W Bush administration.[Russian envoy to UN saddened by Nikki Haley’s resignation]During her time in Ottawa, she raised eyebrows when she said that she believes in “both sides of the science” when it comes to climate change. Craft has also been a supporter of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade deal that was negotiated by the Trump administration to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), although not yet approved by Congress. The Kentucky native has been married to billionaire coal mining businessman Joe Craft since 2016. The couple are both long-term and generous donors to the Republican party."

Stopped aid to Pakistan as they weren’t helping: President Trump President Trump’s comments come at a time when India has gone on a diplomatic offensive against Pakistan, and is trying to isolate Islamabad diplomatically.Further, led by the US, the international community, including the United Nations (UN), has condemned the Pulwama attack in the strongest terms, and has also urged Pakistan to stop providing a safe haven to terror groups on its home soil.Pakistan could also be blacklisted by the FATF On February 14, a CRPF convoy heading towards Srinagar came under attack in the Jammu-Srinagar highway.Despite the highway being well-guarded, an SUV laden with 350kg of explosives managed to ram into the convoy, triggering a massive blast.The blast reduced one bus to smithereens, and left several vehicles in the convoy severely damaged.Over 40 jawans were martyred, and Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) claimed responsibility."
160,‘We Look Forward To Making India A USD 10 Trillion Economy’: PM Modi,"New Delhi:Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday laid out his vision for making India a USD 10 trillion economy, and the third-largest in the world, saying he wants the nation to have countless startups, and be a global leader in electric vehicles.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his five-year tenure had laid a solid economic foundation in the country eradicating the complete policy paralysis that had set in during the last Congress-led UPA regime.Addressing a business summit organised by a newspaper, PM Modi said, ‘Total policy paralysis was observed before during the previous Congress-led UPA government. Change is clearly visible today.’He criticised the runaway inflation, rising Current Account Deficit (CAD) and complete policy paralysis in 2013-14.BJP-led NDA rule witnessed the highest post-liberalisation growth rate of 7.4 per cent and the lowest inflation of less than 4.5 per cent, PM Modi said.Reforms like the Goods and Services Tax (GST) have laid a solid foundation for higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, he said.He added: ‘We look forward to making India a $10 trillion economy and the world’s third-largest economy.’"
161,Jaitley Describes Pak As ‘Rogue State’; Says Pulwama Incident Still Fresh,"New Delhi : India will exercise all options, diplomatic or otherwise, to win a decisive battle against Pakistan which is responsible for the Pulwama terror attack, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Friday.Describing Pakistan as a “rogue state”, he said it is not acting against perpetrators of the attack, though the guilty have themselves admitted to the attack and were taking credit for it.Referring to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s speech, Mr Jaitley said, “the head of the government says, give me actionable intelligence. You need an actionable intelligence if it is a blind offence, but here is a man sitting in your own country who owned up to the offence. So when there is a confession…You have people sitting in your own country and admitting to the offence and saying that yes we have done it and taking credit for it”.Pakistan leadership, he said, is “riding a tiger on this issue, and a tiger never spares its own rider”.More than 40 paramilitary personnel died in a terrorist attack on February 14 at Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir.India is furious, he said, adding “In my lifetime, we have seen wars, we have seen human tragedies, we have seen prime ministers assassinated by terrorists. But the kind of anger which has been there, even on previous occasions, the one this time is unprecedented.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already stated that India will exercise all its instruments at its command, whether it is diplomatic or otherwise.“Therefore, we have to act in a manner that this battle has to be decisively won by us because Pakistan is not willing to give up its traditional role in our neighbourhood as a rogue state,” the finance minister added.“This is not a one-week battle. It should be undertaken in various forms,” he said, while speaking at the Global Business Summit in Delhi.Talking about India playing cricket matches with Pakistan, he said at this juncture the atmosphere is hostile and hence the country can not seen to be playing friendly or even competitive matches with them.“The feeling of the people (on this issue) is understandable,” Mr Jaitley added.The Committee of Administrators or CoA running Indian cricket on Friday decided against taking any stand on the World Cup clash against Pakistan, which is scheduled for June 16 in Old Trafford in England, but said it would individually urge ICC members to “sever ties with any nation that is a terrorist hub”.In a meeting to address the spiralling speculation around the match, the CoA deliberated on the matter but did not take any position for now.There is also a view that India stand to lose by boycotting Pakistan in the upcoming cricket World Cup as it will lose points, harming its prospect in the championship."

He also mentioned about accelerating measures to root out terrorism and extreme.“We need to move to ensure that militancy and extremism are rooted from the society and the State never becomes hostage to extremists,” Khan said as he directed both the interior ministry and the security institutions to immediately accelerate actions on the ground.After the Pulwama attack, New Delhi reached out to the international community, most of which condemned the terror strike, to isolate Pakistan and to highlight the role of the neighbouring country in using terrorism as an instrument of state policy."

169,Total Dhamaal Rolls Out A Carpet Of Sad Jokes & Witless Characters,"Total Dhamaal is densely populated. It has Anil Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit, Ajay Devgn, Riteish Deshmukh, Arshad Warsi, Javed Jaffrey, Boman Irani, Pitobash Tripathi, Mahesh Manjereker, Sanjay Mishra and even an Esha Gupta. There is Indra Kumar at the helm of the project and not one but three people responsible for writing the screenplay and yet apart from getting together the ensemble cast, everything else seems to be an afterthought. The one-line story about a motley group of people chasing Rs 50 crore hidden in some godforsaken zoo, brings in its wake as many inanities and absurdities as possible. Trains, cars and helicopters crash, bridges fall, buildings are on fire and jokes well past their best-before dates are thrown at us.Anil Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit paired as an always bickering couple – a Gujarati husband and Marathi wife – hardly manage even a quarter of the magic they have created in their previous outings together. The same old husband-wife jokes that even the irritating uncle doesn’t send anymore on the family WhatsApp group have been dug out!Ajay Devgn and Sanjay Mishra are miscreants on the run from Police chief (Boman Irani). A carpet of flat jokes and mundane contrivances welcome these half-baked characters. Riteish Deshmukh who is usually brilliant with his comic timing gets to be a greedy fire fighter who will do anything for money. Deshmukh is capable of so much more than what this film allows him to do. One can only endure his scenes with Johnny Lever.Arshad Warsi and Javed Jaffery another talent duo reprise their roles as the original Adi Manav, and somehow this was the only track that kept the laughs coming by the sheer dint of their comic artistry.The first half conjures up many improbable scenes that are supposed to be funny. Finally, en route to the zoo for the promised bounty, the post-interval story follows the predictable trajectory in the most lumbering fashion. The zoo keeper is Esha Gupta. So smitten is Ajay Devgn with her that he starts chomping at the bush he is hiding behind, till Sanjay Mishra says “focus bro focus”. This was painful to watch!The zoo animals made up of low budget CGI and special effects are supposed to do what the humans so far failed to do – get us to care about the on-screen proceedings . Mahesh Manjereker makes an entry as the villain who wants to grab the zoo land. Somewhere someone else breaks up the word “jaanvar” for us – “Aap toh inki jaan ho bas ab inhe apna var maan lo!”Crystal the monkey has a couple of scenes till everyone is too tired to move and the end credits roll along with a song that adds little value to anything.This is the same film which has Sonakshi Sinha’s utterly unnecessary item song and a rehashed version of Paisa Paisa! The music, also an afterthought!Total Dhamaal is not as bad as the trailer, it’s worse – because the trailer was just for a few minutes and this one goes on for a couple of hours! Like the characters in the movie, the makers too, are eager to do anything for the ‘karoron ka business’. I don’t know the box office collection but if you value your time and money – you might want to sit this one out!"
170,Chambal Review: A Satisfying Thriller,"An air of mystery surrounds some biopics. Shielding their films from last minute hiccups, filmmakers vehemently deny a direct resemblance to one particular incident or individual. But, it’s not hard to notice the similarities when they hit the screens.Mani Ratnam claimed his Guru isn’t based on Dhirubhai Ambani’s life. However, the story of an ambitious small-town youngster becoming one of India’s biggest business tycoons played out like a tribute to Ambani.Chambal too battled controversy (minor) and had questions to answer. The makers rubbished reports that it’s a take on IAS officer DK Ravi who was found dead at his residence under suspicious circumstances in 2015. So is Chambal Ravi’s story? Well, you take a guess!With Chambal, director Jacob Verghese has developed a flair for creating believable worlds of honest men in civil service. The atmosphere that surrounds these upright officers and the barriers that pull them down is made genuine by Jacob. The portrayal was convincing in the Puneeth Rajkumar starrer-Pruthvi (2010). It is, for the most part, convincing in Chambal too.Subhash (Sathish Ninasam), a dedicated IAS officer, takes on men in power and aims to bring out their misdeeds in the open. He is proud of his duty and has a heart for the underprivileged. But is it a world for ‘good’ people?The films works well as a thriller. Looking at a run-time less than two hours, I wondered whether the host of characters revealed in the promos can sync well with the story. They do, thanks to the smart writing. Every scene feels real and keeps you invested. The dialogues, thankfully, aren’t over the top.Chambal is also a film that believes it’s important to provide satisfying time to its characters and not just magnify the lead. And the cast performs brilliantly here. Roger Narayan as the corrupt businessman, Achyuth Kumar as the unethical police officer and the duo of Mahantesh and Sardar Sathya as cold-blooded killers are terrific. They make you squirm and that’s Chambal’s biggest success.The unorthodox camera work and the decently gripping background score (Poornachandra Tejaswi and Judah Sandy) keep Chambal on the move with good rhythm.Satish gets the body language of a sincere officer right. He is good with the powerful dialogues. But he fails to show the desperation and helplessness needed for the character. A better performance in that area could have added more grace to his role.The film’s pace is also a problem at some places. Chambal is so fast that it forgets to breathe. Jacob isn’t interested in the person in Subhash. He only dwells on the professional in him and that’s a bit disappointing. One would have loved to know the journey that made him the fearless officer. Or how he, despite a hectic work-life, plays the role of a husband (to Sonu Gowda who is wasted).Chambal isn’t entirely moving but it’s a satisfying thriller that keeps you engaged throughout."
171,"International Olympic Committee’S Ban On Sporting Events In India, For Denying Visas To Pakistani Shooters","Sports| After the Pulwama terror attacks, the International Olympic Committee has banned India from organizing of upcoming sports events after denying visas to two Pakistani shooters to Delhi . At the same time, the IOC has appealed to all international sports associations not to allow organizing of sports in India . In India, two Pakistani shooters were not given visa to India for World shooting competition.After this decision, the Olympic Committee has stopped all kinds of talks with India . At the same time, India has been asked for a guarantee that unless the government seeks the permission to complete the Olympic charter, till then the Games will not be organized here.India Breaks Olympic CharterThe committee says that not giving the visa to the players coming to the competition is against the principles of the Olympic Charter. No host country can discriminate with players like this. The committee tried to resolve this issue till the last time but India did not give visa to Pakistani players. After this the decision has been taken by the IOC.Petitions filed for the upcoming Games on behalf of India have also been put on hold. At the same time, the committee has appealed to other international sports associations not to allow the Games to be organized in India , unless the Indian government does not guarantee the involvement of the players in writing.Olympic quota cancellationLet us tell you that this competition from the International Shooting Sports Federation (ISSF) is going on in the shooting range from Thursday to Dr. Karni Singh of Delhi . From this, 16 quota would have been achieved for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, , which has now been canceled. After the terrorist attack in Pulwama, the Indian National Rifle Association said that our government had approved the application of Pakistan players but before the attack,Pakistan had applied for visa for two shooters GM Bashir and Khalil Ahmed for this World Cup. Both of the shooters were of Rapid Fire category, which were not granted the visa. The Pakistani terrorist organization Jaish-e-Mohammad has taken responsibility for the Pulwama attack, in which 40 CRPF personnel were martyred. India believes that Pakistan gives shelter to these terrorist organizations and does not take any action against them."
172,ISL: Mumbai Hope To Turn It Around Against Desperate ATK,"ATK and Mumbai City FC have everything to play for as they chase a place among the top four in the Indian Super League (ISL) at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan here on Friday.Mumbai City are better placed with 27 points from 16 matches and will qualify with a win. ATK have 21 points and can touch fourth-placed Mumbai’s tally but need too many things to go in their favour. Chiefly, though, they must secure all points against Mumbai. “It’s very difficult to qualify but it is possible. We obviously cling on to that hope. If we were to win it, we would be within reach of Mumbai. We’d also have a better head to head against Mumbai if we win. You never know what would happen in football,” ATK coach Steve Coppell said. The Kolkata side’s playoff dreams have taken a big hit after a 2-2 draw against FC Pune City was followed by a comprehensive 0-3 loss to FC Goa. So precarious is the spot, that Coppell’s men now find that even two wins out of two might not be enough to guarantee a playoff spot and they will still need plenty of other results to go their way to achieve that target.The home form for ATK has not been the greatest with one draw, three wins and as many losses to show in their seven outings so far. With both their remaining two league games set to take place in Kolkata, the hosts will have to capitalise on their home support and overturn that patchy form. For Mumbai, the equation remains simple. The Islanders can confirm their spot in the playoffs with a win but their current form will not inspire plenty of confidence. Jorge Costa’s side were on a nine-match unbeaten run which included an impressive 1-0 win over Bengaluru FC but have since faced three losses on the trot.“The last three games we didn’t play like we could. We had injuries and suspensions plague our form and we made a lot of mistakes. What we must look into is that we’re making a lot of mistakes. But I still believe in this team, as before these three games we were going strong and winning games,” said Costa. Unlike ATK, Mumbai’s playoff hopes remain in their own hands with two games to play.Their final league clash is an unpredictable Maharashtra derby against a resurgent Pune City and the Islanders will want to book their final-four spot on Friday itself. But first they have to rediscover their scoring boots. In their three recent losses, Costa’s men have failed to score a single goal and that will be the most worrying aspect for the Portuguese coach. ATK are still alive but Mumbai should fancy their chances of turning it around. "
173,IOC Suspends India From Hosting Olympic-Qualifying Events,"The International Shooting Sports Federation (ISSF) announced on Thursday that all the 16 quota places for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics on offer at the shooting World Cup here have been scrapped due to denial of visas to Pakistan players.According to ISSF President Vladimir Lisin, the decision was taken by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) following the controversy over the participation of the Pakistan contingent.“The IOC has decided that no quota places for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics will be on offer at this World Cup due to denial of visas to Pakistan players,” Lisin told reporters here on Thursday.“The bad news is that the Pakistan players have not been granted visas for this World Cup and according to the IOC charter, there should be no discrimination of any sort,” he added.The IOC decision comes after several days of ambiguity over the participation of the shooters from Pakistan.The National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) Secretary Rajiv Bhatia had told IANS on February 18 that G.M. Bashir and Khalil Ahmed – the two Pakistanis due to take part in the 25 metre rapid fire pistol category – have been granted visas.However, the National Rifle Association of Pakistan (NRAP) wrote to the ISSF on Wednesday, insisting that its shooters have been denied visas and requested that the two Olympic quotas on offer in the 25 metre rapid fire pistol category should be scrapped.In its letter to the ISSF, the NRAP had requested that those quota places should instead be included in the next ISSF World Cup in Beijing.The various events of the ISSF World cup will be held between February 23 and February 27 at the Dr Karni Singh Shooting Range here."
174,ICC Reflects On Reports Of Pakistan World Cup Ban,"There were stories floating around the internet of Pakistan world cup ban. This talks emerged after the brutal attack by terrorists on India CRPF bus, that martyred 42 CRPF soldiers. There are no such good relations between India and Pakistan.About the stories of Pakistan world cup ban, ICC chief Dave Richardson on Tuesday said the cricket’s governing body had no reasons to make any changes to the proposed World Cup schedule and that all matches will be played as scheduled.“No indications have been sent from either board about the World Cup clash not taking place,” Richardson told ESPNcricinfo in London, where he was present to mark the 100-day countdown to the tournament. “We haven’t written to the boards as yet.”BCCI also hasn’t reached out ICC concerning the ban for Pakistan in the world cup. Even BCCI reaches with the idea, there is no way Pakistan could be banned from the playing world cup.“Remember, Pakistan have gone through the due process needed to qualify for this World Cup. ICC cannot ban a team that has done nothing wrong. One needs a strong cricketing reason for a particular team to be banned. What is the Pakistan team’s fault here? Pakistan’s legal position is very strong and ICC knows this so they will not throw themselves into any legal battle,” a source told mid-day yesterday.“Besides, according to resolution 2.3 [h] of the ICC constitution ‘Each Member is entitled [subject to meeting any relevant qualification criteria] to participate in certain cricket events organized or sanctioned by the ICC’. Also, all member countries are signatories to the Members’ Participation Agreement [MPA], so any decision like this can only be taken if all members are in unison for a valid reason, but there is no valid reason here. The ICC has never banned any team on the request of another,” added the source.Until now, Pakistan World cup ban is just a faux. India &amp; Pakistan will be facing each other in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019. The arch rivals are scheduled to meet on 16th June 2019, in the league stage game for the world cup."
175,IOC Pulls Up India After 2 Pakistani Shooters Denied Visas For WC,"The IOC has suspended all discussions with India regarding hosting of global events.The action has been taken after two Pakistani shooters were denied visas for the New Delhi World Cup that starts on Friday.Olympic qualification quota for the Pakistani shooters’ 25m rapid fire event has been revoked from the Delhi World Cup.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has taken strict action against India and decided to “suspend all discussions” regarding hosting of global sporting events after two Pakistani shooters were not issued visas for the ISSF World Cup that begins on Friday, 22 February, in New Delhi.The IOC also revoked the Olympic qualification status of the men’s 25-metre rapid fire event in which the two Pakistani shooters were to participate in New Delhi.The IOC said it will not allow India to organise Olympic-related events in the future, unless written assurances are obtained from the government.Pakistan had applied for visas for shooters GM Bashir and Khalil Ahmed for the WC in New Delhi that also serves as a qualifier for the 2020 Olympic games. However, following the Pulwama terror attack in which over 40 CRPF personnel were martyred on 14 February, Indian authorities denied visas to the two shooters and one official.The IOC’s decision came hours after International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) President Vladimir Lisin announced in New Delhi that all the allotted 16 Olympic quotas for the 2020 Games would be scrapped. However, the IOC limited the withholding of quotas to only two while retaining 14.“The IOC restricted the withdrawal of recognition as an Olympic qualification event to the 25m rapid fire pistol competition in which the two Pakistani athletes were supposed to participate. This happened in the interest of the other 500 athletes from 61 countries participating in the other events who are already in India for their competition,” the IOC said in a statement after its executive board meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland on Thursday.,”Since becoming aware of the issue and in spite of intense last-minute joint efforts by the IOC, the ISSF and the Indian National Olympic Committee (NOC), and discussions with the Indian government authorities, no solution has been found to allow the Pakistani delegation to enter India in time to compete,” the statement said.The IOC came down heavily on India for going against the Olympic charter.“As a result, the IOC executive board also decided to suspend all discussions with the Indian NOC and government regarding the potential applications for hosting future sports and Olympic-related events in India, until clear written guarantees are obtained from the Indian government to ensure the entry of all participants in such events in full compliance with the rules of the Olympic charter,” the IOC said.The World Cup got underway in New Delhi on Friday and the men’s 25m Rapid Fire Pistol event is slotted for Tuesday with Indian 16-year-old Anish Bhanwala a medal contender, in home conditions. Bhanwala had finished on top of the podium in this very event at the 2018 Commonwealth Games and the 2018 Junior World Cup. Due to this controversy though, even if he were to finish in the top two, Bhanwala will have to wait for another quota event to book himself a spot in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.The National Rifles Association of India (NRAI) President Raninder Singh though expressed his gratitude to all parties involved in helping retain the Olympic qualification status for the other 14 spots at the World Cup.“The Organising Committee of the New Delhi World Cup wishes to unequivocally thank the ISSF President Vladimir Lisin, the ISSF Secretary General Alexander Ratner, the IOA President Dr. Narinder Batra, and the Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports Col (Retd.) RVS. Rathore for ensuring the best possible outcome to a vexed and complexed scenario. The NRAI is Committed to working with the ISSF, IOA, and the Ministry of sports to ultimately addressing the future consequences of this most peculiar and unprecedented scenario brought on by reasons beyond the regular control of the NRAI and the ISSF,” "

“If you are confident about your sexuality, you don’t have to have eight women around you twerking,” Obama said, receiving a wide round of applause. He also said that people didn’t have to flaunt their wealth if they are confident about their financial status and the same applied to other things as well.The Democratic politician also cited his personal life to strengthen his point. He said he is happy to be in love with just woman who is his wife Michelle Obama, also a popular figure in the US.“I mean why are you all like…you seem stressed that you got be acting that way.

184,Centre To Carry Out Survey To Gauge Perception On Police Services,"The Union Home Ministry will carry out a pan-India survey to assess public perception on citizen-centric police services like women safety and reporting of crimes, officials said on Thursday, 21 February.The survey will commence next month and cover a representative sample of 1.2 lakh households spread over 173 districts across the country, based on the National Sample Survey framework.All the states and the Union Territories would be included in this survey and it will be completed in nine months, a Home Ministry official said.The survey is aimed to understand public perception about police, gauge the level of non-reporting of crimes or incidents to police, the position on ground relating to crime reporting and recording, timeliness and quality of police response and action, and experience regarding women and children’s safety.The outcome of the survey is expected to bring out useful suggestions for stakeholders in formulating and implementing appropriate policy responses and changes in the functioning of police, and for improving crime prevention and investigation, and for transformation in community policing.It is also expected to improve access to justice, and increased or appropriate resource allocation for police in a systematic manner, the official said.From time-to-time, several initiatives have been taken by the central government, aimed at facilitating and supplementing the efforts of state governments and the Union Territories in providing citizen-centric police services.A globally accepted way to assess the impact or outcomes of such endeavours is through a holistic analysis of services rendered to the public, through public perception surveys conducted by professional and independent agencies.Such surveys are globally tested tools for improving service delivery in policing and enhancing public satisfaction.Govt Approves Air Travel for Central Armed Police Forces in J&amp;KThe Home Ministry has commissioned the Bureau of Police Research and Development to conduct this pan-India survey called the ‘All India Citizens Survey of Police Services’, another official said.The survey will be conducted through the National Council of Applied Economic Research in New Delhi.The states and the UTs have been requested to extend full cooperation to the conduct of the survey, and to adopt this good practice and prepare their police for undertaking such surveys on their own in the future, the official said."
185,"A Fed Pivot, Born Of Volatility, Missteps, And New Economic Reality","WASHINGTON – The Federal Reserve’s promise in January to be “patient” about further interest rate hikes, putting a three-year-old process of policy tightening on hold, calmed markets after weeks of turmoil that wiped out trillions of dollars of household wealth.But interviews with more than half a dozen policymakers and others close to the process suggest it also marked a more fundamental shift that could define Chairman Jerome Powell’s tenure as the point where the Fed first fully embraced a world of stubbornly weak inflation, perennially slower growth and permanently lower interest rates.Along with Powell’s public comments, Fed minutes, and other documents, the picture emerges of a central bank edging towards a period of potentially difficult change as it reviews how to do business in light of that new reality. One question, for example, is whether to make crisis-fighting policies a part of the routine toolkit.

But it was a brief Oct. 3 remark by Powell that set off the chain of events which helped settle the matter.“We’re a long way from neutral now, probably,” Powell said at a Washington think-tank event, referring to a level of interest rates that neither cool or boost the economy.Though Powell was effectively summarizing what the Fed had just concluded at its Sept. 25-26 policy meeting, when it raised rates amid stronger than expected U.S. growth, his characterization touched a nerve.Investors dumped stocks and bonds, fearing the Fed aimed to drive rates higher than they felt the economy could withstand.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=705010941&amp;adf=545812880&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.11~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615633466&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fa-fed-pivot-born-of-volatility-missteps-and-new-economic-reality%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615633466736&amp;bpp=2&amp;bdt=1321&amp;idt=2&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3Ddaa44c41f3b68edb-22fbb11ae0c6001c%3AT%3D1615633425%3ART%3D1615633425%3AS%3DALNI_Ma9gEyQjd0AFDomx5Oj-WpesYNEIQ&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=7412491141979&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1804607154.1615633422&amp;ga_sid=1615633466&amp;ga_hid=414440634&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=8&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2066&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=21069710&amp;oid=3&amp;psts=AGkb-H-di-BmCzc-343UB6lznAdq9pX93YoTUSkQJnCIw3uWdixvBf7kffIYlwU369NZdPjIdidILTCf5dpQ&amp;pvsid=2955363592087991&amp;pem=396&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=9vPTPaBgpe&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=49"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CJqR8tePre8CFVkHrQYdIFYF3Q"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
It was the beginning of weeks of volatility that led the Fed to recalibrate its message, with more than one misstep along the way.In doing so, the central bank went beyond fine-tuning its language or adjusting to changing conditions. Interviews with officials as well as analysis of Fed minutes and policymakers’ public statements suggest the emergence of a long-elusive consensus that interest rates would likely never return to pre-crisis levels, and that once established relationships, such as inflation rising when unemployment fell, no longer worked.Concern that years of solid economic growth and falling unemployment would inevitably rekindle inflation or threaten financial stability have been a staple of Fed debates, but had largely disappeared by the Fed’s Dec. 18-19 meeting, according to a review of Fed meeting minutes and officials’ public statements.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_4"" name=""aswift_4"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=705010941&amp;adf=841719894&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.17~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615633467&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fa-fed-pivot-born-of-volatility-missteps-and-new-economic-reality%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615633466744&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=1330&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3Ddaa44c41f3b68edb-22fbb11ae0c6001c%3AT%3D1615633425%3ART%3D1615633425%3AS%3DALNI_Ma9gEyQjd0AFDomx5Oj-WpesYNEIQ&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280%2C699x280%2C699x280%2C1017x586&amp;nras=6&amp;correlator=7412491141979&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1804607154.1615633422&amp;ga_sid=1615633466&amp;ga_hid=414440634&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=8&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2145&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=21069710&amp;oid=3&amp;psts=AGkb-H-di-BmCzc-343UB6lznAdq9pX93YoTUSkQJnCIw3uWdixvBf7kffIYlwU369NZdPjIdidILTCf5dpQ&amp;pvsid=2955363592087991&amp;pem=396&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=5&amp;uci=a!5&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=lfgNnsdh3N&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=882"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!5"" data-google-query-id=""CMGZp9iPre8CFbYTrQYdkkQEzg"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
It was a conclusion hiding in plain sight. After a year when the Trump administration pumped around $1.5 trillion of tax cuts and public spending into a full employment economy, the Fed in 2018 would miss its 2 percent inflation target yet again.“I hate to say we were right,” Dallas Federal Reserve president Robert Kaplan told reporters on Jan. 15 in Dallas. “But we have been warning for quite some time that…the structure of the economy has changed dramatically.”Technological innovation, globalization, and the Fed’s commitment to its inflation target all held down prices, and “those forces are powerful and they are accelerating,” he said.His arguments echoed those made by St. Louis Fed president James Bullard and Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari. New Fed vice chairman Richard Clarida and Governor Lael Brainard have flagged similar issues.Later in January, the Fed’s policy meeting jettisoned mention of any further rate increases and cited “muted inflation” among the reasons, largely aligning the Fed with the prevailing sentiment among investors who saw conditions weakening.At first, it was investors who appeared to have overreacted to Powell’s “long way from neutral” remark in early October.Global markets had absorbed nearly two years of quarterly Fed rate increases in stride, but yields on U.S. 10 year Treasury bonds spiked a tenth of a percentage point that day and stocks started a slide that wiped out 10 percent of the S&amp;P 500’s value by late November.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
If sustained, It was the type of environment, with asset values falling and borrowing conditions tightening, that could hurt the Main Street economy and not just the investor class.The initial response from Powell and others at the Fed was that the U.S. economy remained strong, and that it was not the central bank’s job to coddle Wall Street.“We watch markets very carefully,” Powell said at a mid-November event in Dallas. “But it is one of many, many factors that go into a very large economy.”But investors were not just reacting to the Fed and the prospect of higher rates. Weakening business and consumer confidence, slowing global growth, and potential disruptions from President Donald Trump’s trade war with China also factored in.Over the next few weeks the Fed tried to build those concerns into its policy stance, but it became clear the situation was more fragile than they had divined.In early December a portion of the bond yield curve “inverted,” with short term rates rising above long term ones in what can be seen as a loss of faith in economic growth.For months, Fed officials had debated whether to discount such developments as the clash and clang of daily trading or to treat them as a significant warning. Some, including Bullard, warned against ignoring what markets seemed to be saying, and both he and Kashkari said the Fed should stop raising rates or risk trouble.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_6_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_6_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
When the Fed met in December, policymakers thought they could square the circle.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_7_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_7_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
Officials proceeded with another quarter-point rate increase, as expected at the time, and released updated projections showing two more rate hikes for 2019 – one less than in September, but still heading higher.LOST NUANCEThe Fed hoped, though, that between a small change in its policy statement and Powell’s follow-up news conference, things would stay calm, a strategy Fed officials spelled out after the fact in interviews and in minutes of the December meeting.By replacing the phrase that the Fed “expected” further rate hikes with one saying it “judged” them likely, the central bank tried to show it was now less committed to tighter policy.But that nuance was lost on markets, and Powell’s assurance at the news conference of a newly “patient” Fed got lost as well when he described the Fed’s monthly rundown of as much as $50 billion in assets as on “automatic pilot.”To investors, that undermined the intended message, since the regular decline in the Fed’s asset holdings effectively worked to tighten financial conditions.The S&amp;P 500 fell another 7.5 percent in the days that followed.Investors felt the Fed was “not fully appreciating” how market turbulence and “softening global data” put the U.S. itself at risk, the Fed’s January minutes concluded in reviewing how the December statement was perceived.“It was a delicate time,” New York Fed President John Williams told Reuters on Tuesday. The tweak in the December statement “was a pretty subtle message. That’s one of the challenges of trying to communicate a very complicated and complex situation in just one page.”Over the next few weeks, the Fed eschewed subtlety for a more public acknowledgement that its view of economic reality had changed.For a Jan. 4 question-and-answer session at the American Economic Association Powell came armed with written notes and a core message that the Fed was “always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly” if conditions weakened.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_8_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_8_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
After the January meeting that message became official. References to the new “patient” approach and “muted inflation,” words cited in minutes of the December meeting, became part of the Fed’s policy statement. A longstanding mention of the need for higher rates was deleted.The changes drew no dissent, with even those who have worried most about inflation and financial risk falling silent.It was a significant moment of unanimity at a central bank that has spent the last decade wondering when, rather than whether, inflation or financial risks would re-emerge. Throughout that era some group of officials – including Powell early in his central banking career – has consistently warned that the combination of falling unemployment, cheap money, and trillions of dollars injected by the Fed’s crisis era policies would inevitably cause problems.As the Fed’s January meeting minutes showed, not all officials have sworn off further rate increases and some noted that a possible turn for the better – a resolution of trade tensions for example – could lead them to raise rates again.But to veteran Fed watchers, the bar is now higher. The January statement, JP Morgan analyst Michael Feroli wrote recently, showed the Fed “subtly but profoundly evolving” to a new view of the world where a variety of forces have changed the way inflation and interest rates work, and have now changed how the central bank responds."
186,"Court Summons Rahul Gandhi, Sitaram Yechury For Linking Gauri Lankesh Murder To BJP-RSS","New Delhi: A metropolitan magistrate’s court in Mumbai has issued summons to Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Sitaram Yechury after a defamation complaint was filed by an RSS worker for allegedly linking journalist Gauri Lankesh’s murder with ‘BJP-RSS ideology’.RSS worker and lawyer Dhrutiman Joshi had filed a private complaint in the court in 2017 against Rahul Gandhi, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, the CPI(M) and its general secretary Yechury.Magistrate P.K. Deshpande on February 18 ordered that ‘process be issued’ against Rahul Gandhi and Yechury.He, however, dismissed the complaint against Sonia Gandhi and the CPI(M), saying a party cannot be held liable for comments made by individuals.The matter was set for further hearing on March 25.Lankesh was shot dead outside her house in Bengaluru in September 2017, allegedly by the members of a right-wing extremist group.Joshi alleged that within 24 hours of Lankesh’s death, Rahul Gandhi told mediapersons that ‘anybody who speaks against the ideology of the BJP, against the ideology of the RSS is pressured, beaten, attacked and even killed’.Why We Should Remember Gauri LankeshYechury too stated that it was the RSS’s ideology and the RSS men who had killed the journalist known for her trenchant criticism of right-wing politics, he alleged.Joshi claimed that these statements slandered the RSS, and therefore a case of criminal defamation under IPC section 500 be registered against Rahul Gandhi, Yechury, CPI(M) and Sonia Gandhi.He named the CPI(M) because Yechury belongs to that party and Sonia Gandhi because she was then Congress chief.In November 2018, the Karnataka police had said that Gauri Lankesh’s murder was a conspiracy by members of Hindutva group Sanatan Sanshtha. Her killing has been linked to the murders of M.M. Kalburgi, Govind Pansare and Narendra Dabholkar.‘It is an act of organised crime.

The murder was planned by a group involved in such killings for five years,” the special public prosecutor said then."
187,India Played Pak In WC During Kargil War As Well: Shashi Tharoor,"Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has stepped into the big debate in Indian cricket right now – Should India refuse to play Pakistan in the ICC World Cup as a mark of respect for the Pulwama attack martyrs?The idea of India pulling out of the 16 June fixture against Pakistan was first put forward by Harbhajan Singh last week and since then many former cricketers, including Sourav Ganguly, Mohammad Azharuddin and Chetan Chauhan have echoed his emotions.The BCCI is holding a meeting in New Delhi on Friday and are in fact expected to write to the ICC, urging the world body to entirely ban Pakistan from the World Cup.Shashi Tharoor though has said that India should not in fact pull out of the fixture as it would be “worse than a surrender”.Shashi Tharoor”Simple reminder – at the height of the Kargil War in 1999, India played Pakistan in the Cricket World Cup. To forfeit the match this year -as so many are clamouring for- would not just cost two points, it would be worse than a surrender, since it would be defeat without a fight. We should not make cricket a substitute for other actions that our Government should be able to take.”In a social media post, Tharoor has posted the result of the 8 June 1999 India vs Pakistan World Cup match that ended in a 47-run Indian victory and drawn focus to the fact that India have never lost to their neighbours in cricket’s showpiece event.If Virat Kohli’s team do forfeit the match this summer, they stand to lose two points in a group stage that sees all 10 teams playing each other. Tharoor is of the view that doing so “would be worse than a surrender, since it would be defeat without a fight. We should not make cricket a substitute for other actions that our Government should be able to take.”Reminder: at the height of the 1999 Kargil War, India played Pakistan in the cricket World Cup, &amp; won. To forfeit the match this year would not just cost two points: it would be worse than surrender, since it would be defeat without a fight. "

190,Operation For Rescuing 5 Jawans Trapped In Avalanche Resumes,"The rescue operation for five Army personnel trapped in snow avalanche at Namgya in Kinnaur district in Himachal Pradesh has been resumed. Over 200 persons of Army, ITBP, local police and District Disaster Management are deployed in the operation.On Thursday, heavy snow, rain and sliding of glaciers had hampered the operation.An army soldier was killed and five others went missing in an avalanche on the Sino-India border on Wednesday. However, the five trapped jawans are feared dead in the avalanche that occurred around 11 am.Speaking to PTI, Superintendent of Police (SP) Sakshi Verma said, “As per GREF authorities, Tinku Nalla block on the National Highway 5 will open by Friday evening.”Five more jawans of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) were also injured in the avalanche. However, they had been rescued, the officials told PTI.Body of Cop Missing In Kulgam Avalanche Found, Death Toll At 8The body of one of the army jawans was recovered, but there was no trace of five others, Kinnaur Deputy Commissioner Gopal Chand told PTI.The deceased jawan was identified as Rakesh Kumar (41) of Ghumarpur village in Bilaspur district of Himachal Pradesh, Kinnaur Superintendent of Police (SP) Sakshi Verma told PTI, adding that the jawans belonged to the 7 JAK Rifles unit of the army.Kumar’s body has been taken to the Pooh civil hospital for autopsy.Chand said the avalanche occurred at around 11 am near the Shipki La border post.According to Army sources, 16 jawans had gone towards the Shipki La border post from Namagya in order to repair a damaged water supply line when the avalanche struck, burying six of them alive. One of them was rescued, but he succumbed to his injuries subsequently.An army spokesperson said the search-and-rescue operation would go on till the last man was retrieved."
191,"J-K Govt Scraps Security Of 18 Separatists Including Geelani, Malik And 155 Politicians","In a major step, the Jammu and Kashmir government late on Wednesday evening downgraded and withdrew the security of 18 separatists.These Hurriyat leaders include Syed Alishah Geelani and Yasin Malik who were left out when security cover of five separatists was withdrawn earlier this week.According to a spokesperson of the Home Department, it was felt that providing security to these separatist leaders is a wastage of scarce state resources which could be better utilised elsewhere.Among the leaders whose security has been downgraded and withdrawn are SAS Geelani, Aga Syed Mosvi, Maulvi Abbas Ansari, Yaseen Malik, Saleem Geelani, Shahid ul Islam, Zaffar Akbar Bhat, Nayeem Ahmed Khan, Mukhtar Ahmad Waza, Farooq Ahmed Kichloo, Masroor Abbas Ansari, Aga Syed Abul Hussain, Abdul Gani Shah and Mohd Musadiq Bhat.In addition, the security of 155 political persons and activists, who did not require the security provided to them based on their threat assessment and their activities, was also withdrawn. This includes Shah Faesal, who resigned from the IAS and Wahid Parray.Through this, over 1000 police personnel and over 100 vehicles were freed to do regular police work.The security cover of five senior separatist leaders – Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, Abdul Gani Bhat, Bilal Lone, Hashim Qureshi and Shabir Shah was already withdrawn on Sunday.In a major step taken in the aftermath of the Pulwama terror attack, the Centre on Sunday withdrew the security cover of five top separatists. The decision comes two days after Home Minister Rajnath Singh slammed “those who take money from Pakistan to create unrest in Kashmir”.The Hurriyat leaders reacted to the move calling it a “propaganda gimmick” while adding that they “do not need it”.‘Don’t need it, won’t change stand’: Separatists as Govt scraps security after Pulwama killingsEarlier, questions were raised on why Geelani – who is under house arrest – being allowed almost daily, to issue anti-India and anti-security forces statements. He was also allowed to address through phone the gatherings at the funeral of terrorists killed in encounters with security forces.Clarifying why Geelani’s name was not on the list, a police officer had said that Geelani was under house arrest and as such no security was provided to him on an individual basis.According to the order, no security forces or cover will be provided, under any pretext, to the five separatists or any other separatist. Other facilities like vehicles provided to the separatists also stand withdrawn.Home Minister Rajnath Singh, during his visit to Srinagar a day after the Pulwama attack had said security given to people getting funds from Pakistan and its snooping agency ISI should be reviewed.Without naming the Valley-based Hurriyat leaders and those indulging in anti-India activities, the Home Minister said there are some elements who are hand-in-glove with terror organisations and ISI in Pakistan.“They are involved in terror conspiracies and as such are playing with the future of the people and especially the youth of Jammu and Kashmir,” he said.“The security cover provided to such elements will be reviewed,” he had announced.According to official figures, a sum of Rs 10.37 crores was spent on the salary of security men of various separatists between 2008 to 2017. Another Rs 49 lakh was spent on the fuel of vehicles escorting them.The three top separatists, Syed Alishah Geelani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Yaseen Malik have been keeping the pot boiling in Kashmir by issuing statements against India and the security forces. The demand to withdraw their security cover has been raised from time to time.Over 44 CRPF personnel were killed and many injured on Thursday in one of the deadliest terror strikes in Jammu-Kashmir when a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) suicide bomber blew up an explosive-laden vehicle near their bus in Pulwama district.The bus was part of a convoy of 78 vehicles carrying around 2500 CRPF personnel from Jammu to Srinagar."
192,General Bipin Rawat Flies LCA Tejas At Aero India,"Indian Army chief General Bipin Rawat became the first Chief of Staff of the Indian Army to fly the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) following a sortie over Bengaluru skies during the ongoing Aero India show.The General took the rear seat in the two-seat fighter jet which took off at around 12.30 pm.Besides highest-ranking military officials of India, Tejas has been previously flown by some of the highest-ranking military officials of foreign nations.Chief of the Air Staff of the United States, General David L Goldfein, was the first highest-ranking officer of any foreign military force in the world to have flow a Tejas when he flew a sortie at Air Force Station Jodhpur on 3 February 2018.Four days later, the chief of the French Air Force, General André Lanata, flew a sortie in the Tejas at the same air force station becoming the second highest-ranking officer of a foreign military power to fly the indigenously-developed fighter aircraft.IAF chief, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa, had flown the Tejas on the first day of Aero India 2017.General Rawat’s sortie came a day after the LCA Tejas MK I got the Final Operational Clearance (FOC). The FOC Certificate and Release to Service Document (RSD) were handed over to the IAF chief on Wednesday in the Defence Secretary Sanjay Mitra and Chairman and Managing Director of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited R Madhavan.ACM Dhanoa called the development “a major milestone for the LCA”.The FOC now enables the Tejas to add capabilities such as Beyond Visual Range Missile capabilities. Air-to-Air Refuelling, Air-to-Ground FOC earmarked weapons and general flight envelope expansion.Initial Operational Clearance (IOC) of the aircraft took place in the year 2013 and IOC standard Aircraft were inducted into IAF No. 45 Squadron in July 2016. The IAF Squadron has since flown over 1500 sorties successfully on the Aircraft.The Tejas light combat aircraft is designed to enhance the Indian Air Force’s fighting capability and replace the existing squadrons of ageing MiG-21s and MiG-27s.The 12th edition of Aero India 2019, the biennial International Aerospace and Defence Exhibition, will be held from 20 to 24 February 2019 at Yelahanka."
193,‘PM Continued Shooting For Documentary After Pulwama’: Cong,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi continued shooting for a film in the Corbett National Park for his “propaganda and publicity” till the evening of February 14 despite the Pulwama attack taking place in the afternoon that day, the Congress on Thursday alleged, citing reports in a section of the media.There was no immediate reaction from the Prime Minister’s Office and the BJP over the allegations.The opposition party also accused BJP president Amit Shah of “politicization of terrorism” in his speech in Assam following the attack in which 40 CRPF jawans died after a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the paramilitary force’s convoy in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama.Shah, while addressing a public rally at Lakhimpur in Assam, had said that the sacrifices of the 40 CRPF personnel will not go in vain as there is a BJP government at the Centre now and it, unlike the previous Congress dispensation, will not “compromise” on any security issue.Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, addressing a press conference, launched an all-out attack on the government and the prime minister over the Pulwama terror strike. In his hunger for power, the prime minister has forgotten “raj dharma” (duty of governance), he alleged. Citing media reports in Hindi news papers, Surjewala gave a timeline of events saying the the terror attack happened at 3:10 pm on February 14 with the Congress reacting at 5:15 pm.“The prime minister also knew about it, yet the PM, a person who claims himself to be a pseudo nationalist, continues to shoot a film (for Discovery channel) for self propagation in Corbett National Park in Ramnagar,” he claimed. He alleged that the prime minister continued to “enjoy boat rides” with the camera crew and later ensured that there is slogan shouting by BJP people in his favour there.“The prime minister continues to eat chai, samosas at seven o’ clock at government expense in a PWD guest house when every single Indian household didn’t eat their food,” the Congress spokesperson said.On one hand the country was picking up the “pieces of our martyrs”, on the other hand the prime minister was doing his “propaganda and publicity”, he claimed.“Can such conduct be expected from the prime minister of a country. The prime minister should have been chairing the cabinet committee on security immediately and should have taken action, instead of shooting films,” he said.Surjewala said that the Congress party had shown restrain as directed by party president Rahul Gandhi, but it was important to raise issues of such conduct that “insults martyrs”.“The Congress party and the entire nation stands united with our armed forces as also our government in every step that they take in tackling Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. We are determined in that resolve even today,” he said.The Congress leader said that questions must be asked about the gross intelligence failure of this government and on the “priorities of a prime minister who on a sensitive time like this has gone on a foreign tour to South Korea instead of tackling terrorism”."

Macron said applying the working definition of anti-Semitism drawn up by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance would help guide police forces, magistrates and teachers in their daily work.Since the inter-governmental organization approved the wording in 2016, some critics of Israel have said it could be used suppress Palestinian rights activists. The definition states anti-Semitism can take the form of “denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour.”Macron said he thinks that view is correct.“Anti-Zionism is one of the modern forms of anti-Semitism,” the French leader said in Paris at the dinner of Jewish umbrella organization CRIF. “Behind the negation of Israel’s existence, what is hiding is the hatred of Jews.”<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=1650265595&amp;adf=769656461&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.7~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615633554&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Ffrance-to-adopt-international-definition-of-anti-semitism%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615633554298&amp;bpp=2&amp;bdt=943&amp;idt=2&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D7757106a71cc9754-22f75f2bdbc600dc%3AT%3D1615633518%3ART%3D1615633518%3AS%3DALNI_MZiXCcRrQgTWqekMz7xK6GTMPYQgw&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=421446119693&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1019047216.1615633515&amp;ga_sid=1615633554&amp;ga_hid=98115056&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=7&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1967&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=42530672&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=933384029097046&amp;pem=995&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=8R9xyGWY7Q&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=47"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CJu41oGQre8CFQddGwodPqMHtg"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
Macron mentioned anti-Semitism based on “radical Islamism” as a rampant ideology in France’s multi-ethnic, poor neighborhoods.Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s Office”Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his appreciation at France’s adoption of the international definition of anti-Semitism, in a phone call with the French leader ahead of the speech.”Macron also said his party would introduce legislation in parliament in May to force social media to withdraw hate speech posted online and use all available means to identify the authors “as quickly as possible.”He especially denounced Twitter as waiting days, sometimes weeks, to remove hate contents and to help authorities so a judicial investigation can be led. At the same time, he praised Facebook’s decision last year to allow the presence of French regulators inside the company to help improving practices combating online hate speech.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_4"" name=""aswift_4"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=1650265595&amp;adf=3152847018&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.13~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615633555&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Ffrance-to-adopt-international-definition-of-anti-semitism%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615633554305&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=950&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D7757106a71cc9754-22f75f2bdbc600dc%3AT%3D1615633518%3ART%3D1615633518%3AS%3DALNI_MZiXCcRrQgTWqekMz7xK6GTMPYQgw&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280%2C699x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=5&amp;correlator=421446119693&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1019047216.1615633515&amp;ga_sid=1615633554&amp;ga_hid=98115056&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=7&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2074&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=42530672&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=933384029097046&amp;pem=995&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=5&amp;uci=a!5&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=Y3OuJrOzwN&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=1033"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!5"" data-google-query-id=""COvik4KQre8CFW1BHQkdkeQEsA"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
Macron’s speech came a day after thousands of people attended rallies across France to decry an uptick in anti-Semitic acts in recent months. On Tuesday morning, about 80 gravestones spray-painted with swastikas were discovered in a cemetery in a small village of eastern France. French President Emmanuel Macron observed a moment of silence Tuesday with parliament leaders at the Holocaust museum in Paris.The Paris prosecutor’s office said Wednesday that a man has been arrested over a torrent of hate speech directed at Jewish philosopher Alain Finkielkraut during a Saturday march by yellow vest protesters.The insults included words like “Zionist!” and “Go back to Tel Aviv!” and “We are France!” The man was taken into custody Tuesday evening after a police inquiry was opened into a suspected public insult based on origin, ethnicity, nation, race or religion.In other incidents this month, swastika graffiti was found on street portraits of Simone Veil, a survivor of Nazi death camps and a European Parliament president who died in 2017, the word “Juden” was painted on the window of a bagel restaurant in Paris and two trees planted at a memorial honoring a young Jewish man tortured to death in 2006 were vandalized. “That’s our failure”, Macron said.Emmanuel Macron, French President “The time has come to act.”"

We stand with the families of our jawans and will always be there for them,’ he said.Former cricketer Virender Sehwag on Saturday took Twitter to announce to take complete care of the education of the children of CRPF jawans in his school.‘Nothing we can do will be enough, but the least I can do is offer to take complete care of the education of the children of our brave CRPF jawans martyred in #Pulwama in my Sehwag International School @SehwagSchool , Jhajjar. Saubhagya hoga,’ Sehwag wrote.India are slated to play limited-overs home series against Australia, starting February 24. Talking about the series, Shami said the team will try to win and dedicate the series to the martyred.When asked about the sporting relations with Pakistan, Shami said ‘whatever the government and BCCI decide, Team India will follow it’.Earlier on the same day, Indian premier League (IPL) chairman Rajiv Shukla made it clear that there is no possibility of bilateral cricket ties between India and Pakistan unless they get government’s nod.Shukla admitted to have faith in the concept of sports being above everything else but asserted that ‘if somebody is sponsoring terrorism’ then it would obviously have an impact on sports.Cricket Club of India (CCI) Secretary Suresh Bafna had said that India should not play a match against Pakistan in the forthcoming World Cup, adding since Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has not come out openly about the attack in Kashmir, it shows that they are at fault somewhere.Around 40 CRPF personnel were killed when a CRPF convoy, while moving from Jammu to Srinagar, was attacked by a suicide bomber in Pulwama on February 14. Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) claimed responsibility for the attack."

198,Aadhaar Data: Indane Gas Website Leaked Details Of Millions Of Customers,"Bengaluru, Feb 19: Aadhaar has been receiving a lot of flak for getting leaked on the web. Now, a French researcher has yet again claimed that he found a major security lapse that allegedly exposed millions of Aadhaar numbers of dealers and distributors associated with Indane, an LPG brand owned by the Indian Oil Corporation.Baptiste Robert, who goes by the online handle Elliot Alderson and has exposed Aadhaar leaks in the past, wrote in a blog post that the Aadhaar data of nearly 6.7 million dealers and distributors of Indane, accessible only with a valid username and password, was left exposed.“Due to a lack of authentication in the local dealers portal, Indane is leaking the names, addresses and the Aadhaar numbers of their customers,” said Alderson.According to a report from TechCrunch, Indane Gas has apparently leaked the data of around 6.7 million subscribers through its website and app.So far, UIDAI hasn’t given out an official statement regarding the alleged leak reported by TechCrunch and Anderson.Aadhaar Database is one of the largest government databases on the planet, where a 12 digit unique-identity number has been assigned to the majority of the Indian citizens.

199,16 US States Sue Donald Trump Over Border Wall Emergency,"Washington: A coalition of 16 US states led by California sued President Donald Trump and top members of his administration, on Monday, to block his decision to declare a national emergency to obtain funds for building a wall along the US-Mexico border.The lawsuit filed in US District court for the Northern District of California came after Trump invoked emergency powers on Friday to help build the wall that was his signature 2016 campaign promise.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=2248246190&amp;adf=734772666&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.3~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615633592&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2F16-us-states-sue-donald-trump-over-border-wall-emergency%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615633592601&amp;bpp=2&amp;bdt=922&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D7757106a71cc9754-22f75f2bdbc600dc%3AT%3D1615633518%3ART%3D1615633518%3AS%3DALNI_MZiXCcRrQgTWqekMz7xK6GTMPYQgw&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1001x280&amp;nras=3&amp;correlator=8422414304907&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1019047216.1615633515&amp;ga_sid=1615633592&amp;ga_hid=1956388432&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=12&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1325&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=42530671%2C31060288&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=345565081547573&amp;pem=995&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=3&amp;uci=a!3&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=nTs0sc5WlG&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=25"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!3"" data-google-query-id=""CPvl9pOQre8CFQfL3godRMsCkA"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
Trump’s order would allow him to spend on the wall money that Congress appropriated for other purposes. Congress declined to fulfill his request for $5.7 billion to help build the wall this year.‘Today, on Presidents Day, we take President Trump to court to block his misuse of presidential power,’ California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement.‘We’re suing President Trump to stop him from unilaterally robbing taxpayer funds lawfully set aside by Congress for the people of our states. For most of us, the office of the presidency is not a place for theatre,’ added Becerra, a Democrat.The White House declined to comment on the filing.In a budget deal passed by Congress to avert a second government shutdown, nearly $1.4 billion was allocated toward border fencing. Trump’s emergency order would give him an additional $6.7 billion beyond what lawmakers authorized.Three Texas landowners and an environmental group filed the first lawsuit against Trump’s move on Friday, saying it violated the Constitution and would infringe on their property rights.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_4"" name=""aswift_4"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=2248246190&amp;adf=1282509345&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.13~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615633592&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2F16-us-states-sue-donald-trump-over-border-wall-emergency%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615633592601&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=922&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D7757106a71cc9754-22f75f2bdbc600dc%3AT%3D1615633518%3ART%3D1615633518%3AS%3DALNI_MZiXCcRrQgTWqekMz7xK6GTMPYQgw&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1001x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=8422414304907&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1019047216.1615633515&amp;ga_sid=1615633592&amp;ga_hid=1956388432&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=12&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2082&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=42530671%2C31060288&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=345565081547573&amp;pem=995&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=0SBdHRpQtj&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=31"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CIyc95OQre8CFXTc3godEqEFFw"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
The legal challenges could slow Trump’s efforts to build the wall, which he says is needed to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The lawsuits could end up at the conservative-leaning US Supreme court.Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Virginia, and Michigan joined California in the lawsuit.The states said Trump’s order would cause them to lose millions of dollars in federal funding for national guard units dealing with counter-drug activities and redirection of funds from authorized military construction projects would damage their economies.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_5"" name=""aswift_5"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=2248246190&amp;adf=3849983616&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.19~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615633593&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2F16-us-states-sue-donald-trump-over-border-wall-emergency%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615633592604&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=925&amp;idt=2&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D7757106a71cc9754-22f75f2bdbc600dc%3AT%3D1615633518%3ART%3D1615633518%3AS%3DALNI_MZiXCcRrQgTWqekMz7xK6GTMPYQgw&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1001x280%2C699x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=5&amp;correlator=8422414304907&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1019047216.1615633515&amp;ga_sid=1615633592&amp;ga_hid=1956388432&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=12&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2105&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=42530671%2C31060288&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=345565081547573&amp;pem=995&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=5&amp;uci=a!5&amp;btvi=4&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=jT2l0ofCCh&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=1000"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!5"" data-google-query-id=""COzJspSQre8CFfci0wodAtMHbg"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
In television interviews on Sunday and Monday, Becerra said the lawsuit would use Trump’s own words against him as evidence that there was no national emergency to declare.Trump said on Friday he did not need to make the emergency declaration but wanted to speed the process of building the wall. That comment could undercut the government’s legal argument.‘By the president’s own admission, an emergency declaration is not necessary,’ the states said in the lawsuit. ‘The federal government’s own data prove there is no national emergency at the southern border that warrants construction of a wall.’"
200,Bengaluru Decks Up For Dazzling Display Of Air Prowess (Aero India Curtain-Raiser),"India’s aerospace hub has been decked up for a show of air prowess by birds of a different kind at the five-day biennial Aero India expo from Wednesday at the Indian Air Force (IAF) Yelahanka base on the city’s northern outskirts.Allaying fears over Asia’s premier air show being shifted from Bengaluru, the Defence Ministry has roped in the Civil Aviation Ministry and the state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) to host the 12th edition of the expo to showcase latest technologies and products by global aerospace majors, with aerial and static displays of their aircraft, including fighters, helicopters, transport aircraft and passenger jets.Vying with state-run Defence Research &amp; Development Organisation (DRDO) and its aerospace arms like ADA, GTRE and CABS and homegrown BEL, L&amp;T, Tata’s Advanced Systems and Godrej are global aerospace majors Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing from the US, Dassault Aviation and Airbus from France and Russian Aircraft Corp MiG pitching for a pie of the multi-billion dollar industry.While delegates and stakeholders hard-sell and network at the expo, the daredevilry feats and spectacular aerial displays of the Indian Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas and Russian Sukhoi SU-30, the medium multirole combat aircraft (MMRCA) Rafale, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F/A-18 Super Hornet and the mighty B-52 Stratofortress bomber will steal the show.The IAF Deputy Chief, Air Marshal V.R. Chaudhari, is likely to fly Rafale.Dassault has flown in three Rafales of the French Air Force — one for the static display and the other two for for flying.The French firm is set to deliver 36 Rafales to the IAF in fly-away condition from September 2019 onwards.The breathtaking formations by the IAF’s Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team (SKAT) in the Hawk advanced jet trainer, the Sarang team in the Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) and the daring manouveres by its Jaguars, Mirages and MiGs will be a delight for thousands of visitors who flock to the venue in droves, especially on the weekend.Besides business delegates from the world over, official delegations from a dozen countries will witness the flypast and aerobatic display on the inaugural day.As against 72 aircraft in the previous edition in 2017, only 61 aircraft have registered for flying and static display on the tarmac of the air base this time.Similarly, the number of global and Indian aerospace firms participating in the expo has slumped to 373 from 549 last time.Of the 373 exhibitors, 200 are from India, 45 from France and 28 from the US. The rest are from countries like Russia, the United Kingdom, Israel, Germany and Italy.The defence behemoth HAL is showcasing its HTT-40 (basic trainer aircraft), upgraded Hawk Mk132 named Hawk-i, civil Do-228 (civil version of Dornier 228 aircraft), Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Rudra, Light Utility Helicopter (LUH) and Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) in its pavilion.“For the first time, HAL’s Supersonic Omni Role Trainer Aircraft (SPORT) simulator will be at the pavilion,” the city-based company said in a statement.The SPORT aircraft will be used for fighter training after advanced jet training stage and before induction of pilots into frontline fighter squadrons.Drone Olympics, student pavillions, start-up challenges and a photography contest are among other highlights at the trade expo.‘Women’s Day’ will be observed on February 23 with panel discussions and flying displays by female personnel.Security has been tightened around the air base by the state police and central forces, with traffic diversions and a ban on flying of aerial platforms like Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and balloons to maintain law and order and security.The city’s airport operator, Bengaluru International Airport Ltd, has also rescheduled departures and arrivals of domestic and international flights to facilitate flying of military and civil aircraft at the air show twice daily."

202,16 States Sue Trump Over Border Wall Emergency,"Washington : Sixteen US States have sued US President Donald Trump over his plan to declare a national emergency to get funding for his controversial wall along the border with Mexico , saying he has veered the country toward a constitutional crisis of his own making. The lawsuit came after Trump on Friday declared that he would spend billions of dollars more on border barriers than Congress had granted him.The National Emergencies Act allows the President to declare a national emergency and unlock a stash of funds by invoking certain statutory authority. The coalition of 16 states in their lawsuit alleged that the Trump administration’s emergency declaration and diversion of funds is unconstitutional and otherwise unlawful.The states include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Virginia . The suit, filed in Federal District Court in San Francisco , argues that the president does not have the power to divert funds for constructing a wall along the Mexican border because it is Congress that controls spending.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_2_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_2_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 280px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: visible;""><iframe id=""aswift_2"" name=""aswift_2"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=3764875216&amp;adf=2371399637&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.3~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615633633&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2F16-states-sue-trump-over-border-wall-emergency%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615633633682&amp;bpp=2&amp;bdt=1285&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3Ded436a0be392c5c0-228fdc81d1c600fc%3AT%3D1615633610%3ART%3D1615633610%3AS%3DALNI_MY2hNO1zLnYdnvF6Y_EwUCllW8efA&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280&amp;nras=3&amp;correlator=7057826390346&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1763793426.1615633607&amp;ga_sid=1615633633&amp;ga_hid=356267032&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=5&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1567&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=44737536&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=2411396078601218&amp;pem=919&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=3&amp;uci=a!3&amp;btvi=1&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=B3qmzxOnkz&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=11"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!3"" data-google-query-id=""CLicvaeQre8CFXoErQYdOokFCw"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
“President Trump has veered the country toward a constitutional crisis of his own making. For years, President Trump has repeatedly stated his intention to build a wall across the United States-Mexico border,” reads the suit.The dispute stems from steps Trump said he would take after lawmakers granted him only USD 1.375 billion for new border barriers, legislation he signed last week to avoid another government shutdown. The fund is far short of the USD 5.7 billion Trump had initially requested.Trump asserted the power to tap three additional pots of money on his own: USD 600 million from a Treasury Department asset forfeiture fund for law enforcement priorities; about USD 2.5 billion from a military antidrug account, most of which would first be siphoned from other military programs the Pentagon has yet to identify, and USD 3.6 billion in military construction funds he said he could redirect by invoking an emergency-powers statute.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=3764875216&amp;adf=823186332&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.9~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615633633&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2F16-states-sue-trump-over-border-wall-emergency%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615633633682&amp;bpp=3&amp;bdt=1285&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3Ded436a0be392c5c0-228fdc81d1c600fc%3AT%3D1615633610%3ART%3D1615633610%3AS%3DALNI_MY2hNO1zLnYdnvF6Y_EwUCllW8efA&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=7057826390346&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1763793426.1615633607&amp;ga_sid=1615633633&amp;ga_hid=356267032&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=5&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2234&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=44737536&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=2411396078601218&amp;pem=919&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=zUqj1mWH8Y&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=16"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""COW5wKeQre8CFdUM5wod9jkCpw"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
Trump declared the national emergency to fulfil his 2016 presidential campaign promise to “build a wall” on the US-Mexico border, which he calls “a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics”.The lawsuit file on Monday seeks to block the Trump administration’s emergency declaration, the unauthorised construction of the border wall, and any illegal diversion of Congressionally-appropriated funds, a media release said.The states allege that the Trump administration’s action exceeds the power of the executive office, violates the US Constitution and federal statutes, and would illegally and unconstitutionally divert federal funds appropriated by Congress for other purposes.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
The lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to block the emergency declaration, the construction of the wall, and any illegal diversion of congressionally-appropriated funds. White House officials said they believe they can unlock an additional USD 6.6 billion through the emergency declaration and other budget maneuvers.The White House believes the money would allow the administration to build at least 234 miles of the border wall. “President Trump is manufacturing a crisis and declaring a made-up ‘national emergency’ in order to seize power and undermine the Constitution,” said California Governor Gavin Newsom.“This ’emergency’ is a national disgrace. Rather than focusing on fighting the real vulnerabilities facing Americans, the President is using the powers of America ‘s highest office to fan the flames of nativism and xenophobia. Our message to the White House is clear: California will not be part of this political theater. We will see you in court,” he said.President Trump treats the rule of law with utter contempt, charged California Attorney general Xavier Becerra.“He knows there is no border crisis, he knows his emergency declaration is unwarranted, and he admits that he will likely lose this case in court. He is willing to manipulate the Office of the Presidency to engage in unconstitutional theatre performed to convince his audience that he is committed to his ‘beautiful’ border wall,” he said.The complaint alleges that the Trump administration’s action declaring a national emergency due to a purported border crisis is unlawful and unconstitutional.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
“President Trump’s hyped crisis is a pretext to justify redirecting congressionally-appropriated funds to pay to build a wall along the southern border after he failed to get Congress — or Mexico — to pay for it. The facts do not support President Trump’s rhetoric or his declaration,” a media release said.“Unlawful southern border entries are at their lowest point in 20 years, immigrants are less likely than native-born citizens to commit crimes, and illegal drugs are more likely to come through official ports of entry. There is no credible evidence to suggest that a border wall would decrease crime rates,” it said.National emergencies can last for one year and then terminate, unless the president renews the declaration 90 days prior, said Robert Chesney, who served in the Justice Department and teaches at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law.Every six months, Congress can consider whether to put forward a joint resolution to terminate the emergency. According to the Brennan Center , there have been 58 national emergencies between 1978 and 2018. Of those, 31 are still in effect today."
203,EU Agrees On Greenhouse Gas Emission Cut For Trucks,"BRUSSELS – The European Union agreed on Tuesday to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from new trucks and buses by 30 percent by a 2030 deadline as part of the bloc’s commitment to cut its output of greenhouse gases.The European Parliament and the Council, which represents the 28 EU member countries, struck a compromise in the early hours that will reduce average CO2 emissions compared with 2019 levels, the European Commision said in a statement.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_2_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_2_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 280px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: visible;""><iframe id=""aswift_2"" name=""aswift_2"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=3453054076&amp;adf=3220866079&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.3~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615633642&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Feu-agrees-on-greenhouse-gas-emission-cut-for-trucks%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615633642063&amp;bpp=2&amp;bdt=1217&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3Ded436a0be392c5c0-228fdc81d1c600fc%3AT%3D1615633610%3ART%3D1615633610%3AS%3DALNI_MY2hNO1zLnYdnvF6Y_EwUCllW8efA&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1034x280&amp;nras=3&amp;correlator=7815320803865&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1763793426.1615633607&amp;ga_sid=1615633641&amp;ga_hid=208147117&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=6&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1310&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=21068083&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=740852461484254&amp;pem=919&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=3&amp;uci=a!3&amp;btvi=1&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=W2Rmqe7IAk&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=35"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!3"" data-google-query-id=""CIeTw6uQre8CFRF70wod7wYLcA"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
“For the first time binding CO2-reduction targets for trucks at the EU-level, including a clear stimulus for zero and low-emission trucks,” Bas Eickhout, a Greens lawmaker who had negotiated on behalf of the European Parliament, said on Twitter.The EU currently has no limits on emissions from heavy-duty vehicles, unlike other countries such as the United States, China, Japan and Canada. Trucks account for almost one quarter of the bloc’s transport-related emissions.Curbs on the transport sector, the only one in which emissions are still rising, aim to help the bloc meet its overall goal of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 under the Paris climate accord.The bloc also has the ambition of being climate-neutral from 2050.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=3453054076&amp;adf=4061092683&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.9~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615633642&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Feu-agrees-on-greenhouse-gas-emission-cut-for-trucks%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615633642063&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=1217&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3Ded436a0be392c5c0-228fdc81d1c600fc%3AT%3D1615633610%3ART%3D1615633610%3AS%3DALNI_MY2hNO1zLnYdnvF6Y_EwUCllW8efA&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1034x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=7815320803865&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1763793426.1615633607&amp;ga_sid=1615633641&amp;ga_hid=208147117&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=6&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1921&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=21068083&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=740852461484254&amp;pem=919&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=uha8fpZ0Yi&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=44"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CKrsw6uQre8CFRsZ0wodE-wJkQ"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>

The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) has lobbied for far lower reduction targets for trucks, saying their potential for electrification is far lower than for cars, particularly for long-haul transit.“Dictating to manufacturers that they must produce a certain amount of zero emission vehicles will not guarantee that market uptake will follow,” it said before talks resumed on Monday.Germany is home to the largest truck manufacturer, Daimler, as well as Volkswagen’s MAN.

204,Facebook Accused Of Revealing Sensitive Health Data,"Facebook has been accused of failing to protect sensitive health data of users in its groups.“Facebook has marketed this product as a Personal Health Record and it then leaked the health data that those patients uploaded to the public,” a complaint filed with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) noted on Monday.The issue was first noticed in July, when members of a women’s group with a gene mutation discovered how easily the names and email addresses of members could have been downloaded in bulk, either manually or through a Chrome extension, The Verge reported.At that time, the social networking giant reportedly claimed to have made changes to “Groups” that ended the practice and emphasised on the option for join “Secret Groups” – that are, although difficult to join, but have a more limited discoverability.However, the complaint highlights that public sharing of privately posted personal health information is in violation of the law, which is a serious problem with Facebook’s privacy implementation methods.“Facebook has ignored our requests to fix the specific issues we have identified to the company, and denies publicly that any problem exists. All of this represents unfair, deceptive and misleading interactions between Facebook and its users in violation of the FTC act,” the complaint added.The complaint, which was filed by a security researcher and others, argues that Facebook has failed to make clear what personal information users might be giving up when they join a group.Facebook is already negotiating a multibillion-dollar fine with the FTC over privacy lapses, The Verge said.The company has not given any official statement on the subject as yet."

207,Israeli Private Spacecraft Shoots For Moon,"Aiming to become the fourth country to make a soft landing on the Moon, Israel’s non-profit SpaceIL has announced it will launch a spacecraft from Florida’s Cape Canaveral on Thursday on board a Falcon 9 rocket.The unmanned craft, weighing 1,300 pounds and standing approximately five feet tall, will then begin an about seven-week journey to the Moon, from where it will send back images of the rocky surface and conduct experiments on the lunar magnetic field.The spacecraft is called “Beresheet,” a reference to the first words of the Bible in Hebrew: “In the beginning…”For decades, the Moon was the exclusive domain of the superpowers. The Soviet Union landed Luna 2 on the Earth’s nearest neighbour in 1959. Three years later, the US landed Ranger 4 on the Moon.These were “hard landings,” meaning the craft crashed into the Moon. The first “soft landings” for both countries came in 1966, when spacecraft made controlled descents to the lunar surface.It would take nearly another 50 years for a third country to perform a soft Moon landing, when China’s Chang’e 3 did it in 2013.If Israel’s spacecraft venture proceeds as planned, it would become the fourth — and by far the smallest — country to do so. It would also become the first private enterprise to make a controlled landing on the Moon, with the smallest spacecraft to do it, and by far the least expensive mission.The total cost of the programme, raised from private donations, is $100 million, a small fraction of the billions of dollars invested in the US space program.“This mission that we were talking about was really a mission impossible,” said entrepreneur Morris Kahn, who donated $40 million to the project.“The only thing is I didn’t realize it was impossible, and the three engineers that started this project didn’t think it was impossible, and the way Israel thinks, nothing is impossible… We are really making this dream come true,” Kahn added.SpaceIL was founded eight years ago to compete in the Google Lunar X Prize, an international competition to see whether a private enterprise could land a spacecraft on the moon, move 500 meters in any direction, and transmit live, high-definition video from the lunar surface.The competition was canceled in January 2018 when none of the five teams left in the competition was able to meet the March deadline for a launch.But some of the teams persisted, determined to land on the Moon even without the incentive of $30 million in prize money.SpaceIL pressed on, signing with Elon Musk’s SpaceX to launch their craft to the Moon on board a Falcon 9 rocket, which is scheduled for launch on February 21.Beresheet will travel approximately 4 million miles on its journey, circling the earth multiple times to gain speed before it slingshots towards the moon. It is scheduled to land on April 11."
208,Pakistan Seeks Imminent UN Intervention To Calm Fresh Tensions With India,"Islamabad: Pakistan has sought the UN’s urgent intervention to “defuse tensions” with India, the Foreign Office said on Tuesday, following one of the worst terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir in which over 40 Indian soldiers were killed.On February 14, at least 41 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed in Kashmir’s Pulwama district in a suicide attack claimed by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad terror group. The attack has heightened bilateral tensions with both New Delhi and Islamabad calling back their envoys. Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday, seeking his help to reduce the tensions between the two countries, Pakistan Foreign Office said.“It is with a sense of urgency that I draw your attention to the deteriorating security situation in our region resulting from the threat of use of force against Pakistan by India,” Qureshi wrote in the letter.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_2_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_2_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 280px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: visible;""><iframe id=""aswift_2"" name=""aswift_2"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=786491199&amp;adf=1970523219&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.3~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615633685&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fpakistan-seeks-imminent-un-intervention-to-calm-fresh-tensions-with-india%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615633685484&amp;bpp=2&amp;bdt=1273&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3Ded436a0be392c5c0-228fdc81d1c600fc%3AT%3D1615633610%3ART%3D1615633610%3AS%3DALNI_MY2hNO1zLnYdnvF6Y_EwUCllW8efA&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280&amp;nras=3&amp;correlator=7857027678079&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1763793426.1615633607&amp;ga_sid=1615633685&amp;ga_hid=266152683&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=11&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1511&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=42530672%2C44735931%2C21068083&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=301524127946397&amp;pem=919&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=3&amp;uci=a!3&amp;btvi=1&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=ZndwEvleG9&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=28"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!3"" data-google-query-id=""COPHnMCQre8CFUNQGwodR_0KWg"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
India has rejected any third party intervention in the Kashmir issue and has maintained that all outstanding matters in Indo-Pak ties should be resolved bilaterally.Qureshi, in his letter, said the Pulwama attack on Indian CRPF soldiers was ostensibly and even by Indian accounts carried out by a Kashmiri resident. He said attributing the attack to Pakistan even before investigations was absurd.He alleged that for domestic political reasons, India deliberately ratcheted up its hostile rhetoric against Pakistan and created a tense environment. Qureshi wrote that India has also hinted that it may abandon the Indus Waters Treaty, asserting that it would be a grievous error.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 280px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: visible;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=786491199&amp;adf=2119852639&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.9~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615633685&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fpakistan-seeks-imminent-un-intervention-to-calm-fresh-tensions-with-india%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615633685484&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=1273&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3Ded436a0be392c5c0-228fdc81d1c600fc%3AT%3D1615633610%3ART%3D1615633610%3AS%3DALNI_MY2hNO1zLnYdnvF6Y_EwUCllW8efA&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=7857027678079&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1763793426.1615633607&amp;ga_sid=1615633685&amp;ga_hid=266152683&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=11&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2094&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=42530672%2C44735931%2C21068083&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=301524127946397&amp;pem=919&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=2WMveJqBF0&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=34"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CPeGnsCQre8CFRKEhQodJFQI6g"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
“It is imperative to take steps for de-escalation. The United Nations must step in to defuse tensions,” Qureshi said. He said India must be asked to conduct an open and credible investigation in the terror attack.“You may also consider asking India to refrain from further escalating the situation and enter into dialogue with Pakistan and the Kashmiris to calm the situation down,” he wrote.The foreign minister requested that the letter should be circulated to members of the Security Council and General Assembly. Pakistan has repeatedly asked the UN to intervene in Kashmir. Former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had also sought the US’ intervention, saying America was the “most relevant” party to get involved in Kashmir issue.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>

211,Pulwama Attack: Pak Approaches UN To Defuse Tensions With India,"Pakistan has sought United Nations’ urgent intervention to “defuse tensions” with India, the country’s Foreign Office said on Tuesday, 19 February, following one of the worst terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir in which 40 Indian soldiers were killed.On 14 February, at least 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed in Kashmir’s Pulwama district in a suicide attack claimed by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad terror group.The attack has heightened bilateral tensions, with New Delhi and Islamabad recalling their envoys.Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday, 18 February, seeking his help to reduce tensions between the two countries, Pakistan Foreign Office said.Pulwama Attack Masterminded by JeM, Pakistan’s ISI: Army“It is with a sense of urgency that I draw your attention to the deteriorating security situation in our region resulting from the threat of use of force against Pakistan by India,” Qureshi wrote in the letter.India has rejected any third party intervention in the Kashmir issue and has maintained that all outstanding matters in Indo-Pak ties should be resolved bilaterally.Qureshi, in his letter, said the Pulwama attack on Indian CRPF soldiers was ostensibly and even by Indian accounts carried out by a Kashmiri resident.He said attributing the attack to Pakistan even before investigations was absurd.He alleged that for domestic political reasons, India deliberately ratcheted up its hostile rhetoric against Pakistan and created a tense environment.Qureshi wrote that India has also hinted that it may abandon the Indus Waters Treaty, asserting that it would be a grievous error.“It is imperative to take steps for de-escalation. The United Nations must step in to defuse tensions,” Qureshi said.Podcast | Post Pulwama, What Can India Do to Avoid Future Attacks?He said India must be asked to conduct an open and credible investigation in the terror attack.“You may also consider asking India to refrain from further escalating the situation and enter into dialogue with Pakistan and the Kashmiris to calm the situation down,” he wrote.The foreign minister requested that the letter should be circulated to members of the Security Council and General Assembly.Pakistan has repeatedly asked the UN to intervene in Kashmir. Former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had also sought the US’ intervention, saying America was the “most relevant” party to get involved in Kashmir issue.The US, however, has time and again reiterated that it is for India and Pakistan to discuss and decide on the pace and scope of their bilateral relationship."
212,"End Caste Discrimination, Identify Those Who Promote It For Self-Interest: PM","Varanasi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday invoked Sant Ravidas on his birth anniversary to urge people to end caste discrimination and identify those who promote it for “self interest”.Modi said caste discrimination is an impediment in achieving social harmony. “Irrespective of caste, creed and other factors, all should get benefit of government schemes,” he said after laying the foundation stone of Ravidas Janmasthali (birthplace) area development project in Varanasi, his Lok Sabha constituency.“Guruji (Sant Ravidas) had said that there should be no discrimination on the basis of caste. Till caste discrimination is there, people cannot connect with each other, social harmony is not possible and equality cannot be ensured,” the Prime Minister said.Without taking any names, he asked people to “identify those who, for their self-interest, create caste discrimination and promote it.”“Unfortunately, caste discrimination could not be removed till now. The New India will witness this change with help of the youth,” he added.Quoting Sant Ravidas, Modi said, “He dreamt of a society where all are taken care of. We have been trying to follow this tenet in the past 4.5 years with ‘Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas'”.Stating that his government focussed on “panchdharma” (five tenets), he said his government focussed on education, income, medicine, irrigation and addressing public grievances. Honesty leads to happiness and “we tried to follow this” (philosophy), he said.Modi said action on ‘benami’ properties and strictness to check circulation of blackmoney was ensured during his government. “‘Chalta hai’ mentality had crept in people, my government tried to change it,” he said.This was the Prime Minister’s second visit to his constituency within a month. On January 22, he inaugurated the 15th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas convention."

214,Steven Spielberg Urges Filmmakers To Make Films For ‘Big Dark Theatre’,"Los Angeles: In a potshot at the streaming services, veteran filmmaker has urged directors to make movies for the “big dark theatres”.During his acceptance speech for the Filmmaker Award at the Cinema Audio Society’s CAS Awards, the 72-year-old director said directors should continue to provide people “the motion picture theatrical experience”, reported Variety.“I hope all of us really continue to believe that the greatest contributions we can make as filmmakers is to give audiences the motion picture theatrical experience. I’m a firm believer that movie theatres need to be around forever,” Spielberg said.The filmmaker then praised the bold work taking place in the television sphere while lamenting how streaming will never compare to the experience of watching a film in a theatre. He did not name any streaming service in particular.“I love television. I love the opportunity. Some of the greatest writing being done today is for television, some of the best directing for television, some of the best performances (are) on television today,” Spielberg said.“The sound is better in homes more than it ever has been in history but there’s nothing like going to a big dark theatre with people you’ve never met before and having the experience wash over you. That’s something we all truly believe in,” he added.This is not the first time the veteran filmmaker has spoken out against the streaming services.Spielberg had previously said that films which debut on streaming services should compete for the Emmys instead of the Oscars"

216,Prabhas Vs Rana Daggubati: Actor Anushka Shetty Finally Declares A Winner,"Mumbai: While rumours about the relationship status of Baahubali co-stars Prabhas and Anushka Shetty continue to make the rounds, Shetty has pulled yet another move that may confuse fans further.The two actors have always maintained that the two are friends, even though rumour mills are ablaze with their link-ups.: Prabhas, Anushka Shetty in a lovey-dovey video from SS Rajamouli’s family weddingNow, reportedly not Prabhas but Rana Daggubati will be starring with Anushka Shetty in her upcoming movie Silence .

217,Ajay Devgn: The Audience Is Changing & The Actors Should Change According To The Times!,"Ajay Devgn says content driven cinema is not a new phenomenon in Bollywood and the actor believes the only difference is that such films have started doing well commercially. The actor cites the examples of films such as Zakhm and those made by Prakash Jha to prove his point.“We did ‘Zakhm’ long back, Prakash Jha has been making such films also for a very long time. Every time they say change has come in terms of content, I wonder why talk about it. Such cinema has started working after multiplexes have come. So earlier these films won’t do business but now they have started working and that is the only difference. Things are happening at it’s pace, you can’t decide ‘I will change’ or ‘things need to change’,” Ajay told PTI.In such a scenario, Ajay believes actors “Need to upgrade themselves through their work as the taste and preferences of audience is changing. They (audience) are changing and you (actors) have to change with time. Today the way my daughter thinks and I think is completely different. I try to grasp from what she is thinking.”“I try to learn what is the mindset and thought process of people today. Emotions are the same but the way we emote and they emote is different, they react to things differently. And we need to learn that for cinema and for ourselves.” The 49-year-old superstar says the audience is only interested to see good cinema right now.“They need to be engaged, entertained. And entertainment just doesn’t mean laughing. Like ‘Uri: The Surgical Strike” engages you, you feel the high. It works, it doesn’t have any song or dance. It connects with the audience. The connect should be there with the audience.”Most Read : Malaika Arora HITS BACK At Salman Khan For Dabangg 3 Exit? Says Dont’ Call Songs As ‘Item Numbers’!In his over two decade long career, Ajay has starred in films like Phool Aur Kaante, Jigar, Vijaypath, Diljale, Pyaar Toh Hona Hi Tha, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam before moving on to projects like Omkara, Golmaal and Singham series, Raid among others. For Ajay, it is essential to grow as an entertainer and as a human being.“I live in the moment. I always did that and will always do. I need to understand what is happening today. I need to understand what today’s generation thinks and how they react to things as that is the reason you can survive as an entertainer. You have to grow with them, understand them and adapt yourself accordingly. Because you are living in today’s world and not yesterday’s world,” he adds.In the current era, where films headlined by Bollywood bigwigs often failing at the ticket window, Ajay says he decides whether to go for remuneration or profit sharing depending on the film. “We all are sensible and we know what the budget is. It is about how much the film can afford, if the film has recovered it’s money then we take some percentage (of profit). Like if I do a ‘Raid’, I know how much it is going to recover so you decide accordingly so that the pressure is not on the producer and on the film.”Currently, the actor is busy promoting his upcoming film Total Dhamaal. He has an interesting line up including De De Pyaar De with Tabu, Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior, Chanakya with Neeraj Pandey, a biopic on the legendary football coach Syed Abdul Rahim and Luv Ranjan’s film with Ranbir Kapoor."

A user questioned him as to who will make a movie on Kashmiri Hindus — if he can’t ?He replied: “Sometimes raising a voice is more important than making a film.”"
219,NBA All-Star Game: Kevin Durant Wins MVP After Powering Team LeBron’S Stunning Comeback,"Kevin Durant scored 31 points and picked up the MVP award as Team LeBron rallied from a 20-point deficit to outgun Team Giannis 178-164 in the 2019 NBA All-Star Game on Sunday.Durant, who also won the MVP award in 2012, got his team untracked in the second half in a game that at one stage threatened to turn into an overblown three-point shooting contest.Giannis Antetokounmpo, one of the two captains along with LeBron James, led all scorers with 38 points as his hand-picked squad scored a record-equaling 53 points in the first quarter and led 95-82 at halftime.“Previously, my first and second all-star, I think I was kind of nervous,” said Antetokounmpo, who has led the Milwaukee Bucks to the NBA’s best record and is an MVP frontrunner this season.“This one I was a little bit more relaxed. I had my name on that MVP until the third quarter, and they got hot and took it away from me.”Defense went out the window especially in the first half, but when it was time to get competitive in the fourth quarter the all-stars buckled down in front of a sold-out crowd of 19,070 at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina.Team LeBron wouldn’t be denied, coming back from a 20-point third quarter deficit with the help of 20 points from Klay Thompson and 19 from Kawhi Leonard. Team LeBron also set a record with a total of 91 three point attempts. The teams combined for 81 three point attempts in the first half alone.“They were scoring too easy,” said Team LeBron player Damian Lillard, who finished with 18 points. “I know it is the All-Star Game but we had to make them work a bit more. In this kind of game you can erase those leads quick.”Paul George and Khris Middleton each scored 20 points for Team Giannis, which got 17 apiece from Stephen Curry and Russell Westbrook in the loss.Durant said he was honored to be part of the festivities. “To be out here amongst so much greatness, I really appreciate it,” Durant said.Charlotte Hornets’ Kemba Walker got one of the loudest cheers of the evening and finished with four points for Team Giannis. James Harden of the Houston Rockets, the NBA scoring leader and last year’s league MVP, had 12 points for Team LeBron.Disgrunted Anthony Davis, who has asked the New Orleans Pelicans to trade him, played just four minutes and had five points for Team LeBron.Honorary all-stars Dirk Nowitzki and Dwyane Wade played a combined 13 minutes and scored nine and seven points respectively. The pair were invited to the game by Commissioner Adam Silver to commemorate their brilliant NBA careers.Wade, an American playing for the Miami Heat, is retiring after 16 seasons and Germany’s Nowitzki has played 21 seasons, all with the Dallas Mavericks. Nowitzki was a perfect three-for-three from beyond the arc in his minuscule three minutes of playing time.“Thank you to the commissioner and to the NBA for allowing us to be on this stage once again,” Nowitzki said during a mid-court ceremony before the start of the final quarter."

221,Chris Gayle To Retire From ODIs After World Cup,"Kingston [Jamaica]: Swashbuckling left-handed batsman Chris Gayle has announced that he will retire from one-day international cricket (ODI) after the World Cup slated to be held in England and Wales later this year.‘Yes, I’m looking to draw the line after the World Cup,’ he said. ‘Or should I say cut the string? Definitely, in 50-over cricket, the World Cup is the end for me. I’ll let the youngsters have some fun and I can sit back in the party stand and watch them have some fun,’ Gayle was quoted by ESPNCricinfo as saying while speaking to reporters.Asked whether he was satisfied with his career, the 39-year-old explosive batsman remarked, ‘You’re looking at a great man. I’m the greatest player in the world. Of course, I’m still the Universe Boss. That will never change. I’ll take that to the grave.’Gayle said that if West Indies lifted the trophy in this year’s World Cup, it would be a ‘fairy-tale finish’ for him.‘Winning the World Cup would be a fairy-tale finish. The youngsters owe it to me to win. They have to do that for me and try and get me the trophy. I’ll be looking to put my input in as well,’ he added.The World Cup is slated to be held from May 30 to July 14.Gayle, who made his debut back in 1999, has scored 9,727 ODI runs in 284 matches and is second only to former West Indies captain Brian Lara who amassed 10,405 runs.In his illustrious career, Gayle has hit 23 ODI centuries.

He is a part of the West Indies squad that will lock horns with England in a five-match ODI series beginning from February 20 in Barbados.Although, the 39-year-old left-hander represented the Caribbean in 103 Test matches, he has focused more on limited-over games, especially in domestic and international Twenty20 tournaments in the last few years.Making himself available for T20s, Gayle said that he is interested in playing in the inaugural ‘100-ball’ competition in 2020 initiated by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).‘I guess England should invite me over. Then I’ll explode the tournament and say ‘thank you guys; bring in a youngster now.’ I’ll set the trend like I did in all tournaments around the world,’ he added. "

225,"Jet Airways Likely To Get Over Rs 3,000 Cr Funds","Loss-making Jet Airways is likely to receive fund infusion worth over Rs 3,000 crore post debt-rejig and investments by Etihad Airways as well as National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) while founder Naresh Goyal might remain the promoter with less than half of the existing majority stake of 51 per cent, according to sources.While the final contours of debt-restructuring and consequent changes are being worked out, an analyst said that Etihad Airways should come as the main driver for Jet Airways as lenders and shareholders would not be able to bring in much value addition. Abu Dhabi-based Etihad, which currently owns 24 per cent in the full service carrier, is a strategic partner and is expected to pump in around Rs 1,400 crore, sources said.On February 14, Jet Airways’ board approved a Bank-Led Provisional Resolution Plan (BLPRP), whereby lenders would become the largest shareholders in the airline. After receiving approval from shareholders, during their meeting scheduled for February 21, part of debt would be converted into 11.4 crore shares at a consideration of Re 1 apiece as per RBI norms.Later, appropriate interim credit facilities by domestic lenders would be sanctioned to the airline, as per a regulatory filing made on February 14. The government-backed NIIF, where Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is a key stakeholder, is likely to acquire little over 19 per cent stake in the ailing airline, they added. They said that NIIF is likely to put in Rs 1,400 crore while lenders, led by the State Bank of India (SBI), are expected to convert debt into equity worth around Rs 600 crore. Sources also said that Etihad’s proposed investments would hike its stake only marginally and that would not trigger the requirement for making an open offer for shareholders of Jet Airways under Sebi regulations. Together, the fresh funding for the airline would amount to about Rs 3,400 crore and Goyal’s stake could reduce to 20 per cent from 51 per cent at present, sources said.Queries sent to Etihad Airways and NIIF on their proposed investments in Jet Airways remained unanswered. Query sent to Jet Airways about Goyal’s stake coming down to around 20 per cent after debt-rejig did not elicit any immediate response. In the three months ended December 2018, Jet Airways reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 732 crore.Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities, said Etihad should come as the main driver of the company and they have to nominate their main people to run the airline because lenders and shareholders are not going to bring in much value addition. Noting that it is an irretrievable situation under the current promoters, Jasani said that who would be the operational owner of the airline would be the most crucial part. “Somebody who has expertise and equity stake has to come.Only then this can be revived. Otherwise we are postponing the problem by a couple of years… If you are not changing the management, then we are going to stay where we are. Same problem will come again,” he said. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said the restructuring exercise is likely to steer Jet Airways away from the turbulence it has been going through for many years now.“The SBI-led consortium of bankers who will be becoming the largest shareholders after the conversion of debt into equity can manage the transition of management over to Etihad plus another partner eventua"
226,"5G, Foldable Smartphones To Dominate Mobile World Congress 2019","The buzz around the first 5G-enabled smartphone and foldable devices will be the talk of the town as the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2019 opens in Barcelona next week.According to Thomas Husson, Vice President and Principal Analyst at Forrester, a global market research firm, the sessions on 5G and foldable phones are likely to cast a shadow over MWC.“There is no denying that 5G is the infrastructure of the connected world, and precisely the reason why it is at the centre of the economic and political war between the US and China,” Husson told IANS.“However, the reality is that it will take another five to seven years before it reaches critical mass among consumers in most countries.“While we will hear a lot about the first 5G smartphones, the challenge is to simultaneously roll-out the infrastructure and it will take time, especially in Europe where spectrum allocation remains a mess at a country level,” he added.Several smartphone and telecom infrastructure players are set to showcase their technologies at the event that begins from February 24 through February 28.“It is likely top smartphone brands will claim to have reinvented smartphone design. However, it will take longer for these foldable screens to reinvent the smartphone category and deliver differentiated experiences,” said Husson.Foldable screens will accelerate the convergence between smartphones, tablets and laptops, progressively unleashing a new form factor.According to Paul Miller, Senior Analyst at Forrester, early experiments in augmented and virtual reality have matured and we’ll see tangible proof points of real value at the MWC.“Endless pilots and proofs of concept in IoT are also maturing, reaching beyond the operational teams where they began into the mainstream business, where they simplify existing processes and open the door to new service-based business models,” he added."
227,FIEO Suggests Series Of Measures To Boost Exports,"Exporters body FIEO Sunday suggested a series of measures including outright exemption from GST, interest subsidy for agri-sector, and more funds for MSME players to boost outbound shipments. With increasing protectionism in several countries, domestic exporters need incentives to increase shipments, Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) President Ganesh Kumar Gupta said. “These support measures, if provided on time has the potential to take the country’s exports to USD 375 billion in 2019-20 and create lakhs of jobs.This fiscal, we will cross USD 325 billion to USD 330 billion,” he said on Sunday. On Goods and Services Tax (GST), he said, it is necessary that an outright exemption window may be provided to exporters as was in existence before the GST regime to mitigate the liquidity problem. “Though, the government has taken several measures to provide quick GST refunds to exporters, but due to one reason or the other, substantial GST refunds remain outstanding for long time causing acute liquidity problem which adversely affect our exports growth,” he said. There is a good potential for agricultural produce in overseas markets and, for that there is a need to extend the interest subsidy scheme to the sector, he added. Besides, the FIEO president sought more funds for improving trade related infrastructure in states, incentives to promote shipments of value added branded products, steps to increase trade with neighbouring countries like Nepal and Bangaldesh, and benefits on sales to foreign tourists.“To reduce transaction time and cost simultaneously increasing competitiveness, there is a need to provide more facility to the MSME exporters in the forthcoming foreign trade policy particularly of non-fiscal nature,” Gupta said adding exemption from IGST under advance authorization scheme. Under this scheme, manufacturers are allowed to import inputs at zero duty but only for the export purposes. During the April-January period of the current fiscal, exports grew 9.52 per cent to USD 271.8 billion. Several key sectors like gems and jewellery, rice, marine product, leather, tea, coffee and cashew has recorded negative growth for the current period.Since 2011-12, India’s exports have been hovering around USD 300 billion. During 2017-18, the shipments grew by about 10 per cent to USD 303 billion."

“Pakistan can raise this issue at different forums including the World Trade Forum,” The Nation quoted him as saying.A day after the terror attack on Thursday, India announced it was taking back the MFN status given to Pakistan in 1995.The status means that a country will treat all World Trade Organisation member states equally in matters of tariffs on imports.After withdrawing the MFN status, New Delhi imposed a 200 per cent import duty on all goods originating or exported from Pakistan."
229,Rising Discom Dues May Adversely Affect Power Supplies: APP,"Joining the chorus against power distribution utilities (discoms) delaying payment to electricity producers, the Association of Power Producers (APP) has said the burgeoning dues may adversely affect electricity supplies. Earlier this month, state-run power giant NTPC had given notices to Andhra Pradesh, Karantaka, Telangana and Jammu and Kashmir for curtaining power supply over pending dues. APP, in a memorandum to the government, sought Power Minister R K Singh’s intervention to resolve the issue. APP is an industry body of 27 leading independent power producers, including Adani Power, GMR, Jindal Power, JSW Energy and Sembcorp Energy India.“We would be grateful if these states can be asked to clear pending payables, as further piling up of dues may result in inability of generations to pay for coal, and in this in turn may adversely affect the power supply position,” APP Director General Ashok Khurana said in the letter to the power minister. According to the letter, the overall pending dues across the country as on November 2018 are more than Rs 25,000 crore, of which the private sector generators’ share is Rs 14,600 crore.The figure does not include the payables regarding change in law, which are about Rs 18,000 crore. The major defaulter states are Uttar Pradesh (total dues Rs 4,119 crore), Maharashtra (Rs 3,457 crore), Karnataka (Rs 3,049 crore), Tamil Nadu (Rs 2,282 crore) and Andhra Pradesh (Rs 2,084 crore). According to the ‘Praapti’ portal, which provides data of outstanding dues of thermal power companies, distribution companies across India owe Rs 40,995 crore cumulatively as on November 2018. The discoms cumulately owe the maximum to Adani Power (Rs 7,321 crore), followed by Lalitpur Power Generation Company Limited (Rs 2,246 crore), GMR (Rs 1,788 crore), Sembcorp Energy India (Rs 1,521 crore) and CLP India (Rs 1,225 crore) among the private producers, as per data on the portal. Last week, state-owned NTPC had issued a notice to Jammu and Kashmir, threatening to cut supplies from February 18 for not clearing outstanding dues of more than Rs 1,600 crore. On February 5, the company had issued similar notices to discoms in Telangana, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh as the states had as much as Rs 4,138.39 crore outstanding dues for over 60 days.However, the notices were later put in abeyance after assurances to make payments. The high level empowered committee headed by Cabinet Secretary P K Sinha has recommended discounting of discoms power bills towards generators. It had suggested in its report submitted in November last year that the Public Financial Institutions (PFI), such as REC and PFC, may discount the receivables from discoms and make upfront payment to the generators.The financial institutions can realise their dues from the discoms in due course of time and charge interest for the period of delay in payment, the panel had said, pointing out that this is a common practice in the business world and most of the banks provide this facility. In December last year, the government had constituted a Group of Ministers (GoM) headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to vet the recommendations of the high-level panel on stressed power projects and forward its comments for consideration by the Union Cabinet. However, the GoM has yet to forward the specific recommendations."

Washington is seeking concrete commitments from Pyongyang at the summit to abandon its nuclear and missile programmes.The United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), with 192 member countries, has been working with Pyongyang to open a new air route that would pass through North and South Korean airspace.Airlines currently take indirect routings to avoid North Korea due to the threat of unannounced missile launches, which have been witnessed by some passengers on commercial flights.If the space was deemed safe, international airlines could save fuel and time on some routes between Asia and Europe and North America, and North Korea could begin reviving its own commercial aviation industry.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_4"" name=""aswift_4"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=2888789187&amp;adf=3918473503&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.9~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615633947&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fnorth-korea-air-traffic-blocked-by-us-ahead-of-trump-summit-report%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615633947463&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=986&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D863652d75ec9e58e-227e7b38d2c6001e%3AT%3D1615633928%3ART%3D1615633928%3AS%3DALNI_MZupgTkCKb2jkAYTAeKCL8-aHySww&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1001x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=1971657157149&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=239973407.1615633924&amp;ga_sid=1615633947&amp;ga_hid=1298751462&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=4&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1982&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=31060288%2C44735932%2C31060352&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=1623358578486820&amp;pem=123&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=Dmg8vSv0Cg&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=61"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CJOem72Rre8CFUNQGwodR_0KWg"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
The cash-strapped country has a population of more than 25 million but its economy has been squeezed by a series of sanctions for its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.Montreal-based ICAO was prepared to help improve North Korea’s aviation system by leading training sessions between its military and civil aviation staff, two sources said.North Korea also asked ICAO for access to U.S.-produced aeronautical charts, they said.But the United States discouraged the UN agency from helping North Korea with its air programme as Washington wanted to “pool all the leverages and incentives” until Pyongyang makes substantial progress on denuclearisation, a third source said.“They would keep tight hold of all available leverage to make sure there is no loophole until the North Koreans take action that deserves a reward,” the source said.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_5"" name=""aswift_5"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=2888789187&amp;adf=2776013920&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.19~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615633948&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fnorth-korea-air-traffic-blocked-by-us-ahead-of-trump-summit-report%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615633947471&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=994&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D863652d75ec9e58e-227e7b38d2c6001e%3AT%3D1615633928%3ART%3D1615633928%3AS%3DALNI_MZupgTkCKb2jkAYTAeKCL8-aHySww&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1001x280%2C699x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=5&amp;correlator=1971657157149&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=239973407.1615633924&amp;ga_sid=1615633947&amp;ga_hid=1298751462&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=4&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2067&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=31060288%2C44735932%2C31060352&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=1623358578486820&amp;pem=123&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=5&amp;uci=a!5&amp;btvi=4&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=VSNCCEcEsL&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=1088"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!5"" data-google-query-id=""COqj1r2Rre8CFRGbGwodrLsOrg"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>

ICAO cannot impose binding rules on governments, but wields clout through its safety and security standards which are approved by its member states.Asked for comment, a US State Department official said it does not publicly discuss details of diplomatic conversations. An ICAO spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The North Korean mission to the United Nations in New York did not respond to a request for comment and there was no immediate reaction from South Korea’s foreign ministry.In 2017, the United States proposed the UN Security Council freeze the assets of state-carrier Air Koryo, which flies to a handful of cities in China and Russia, as part of new sanctions on Pyongyang. The measure was dropped during negotiations between the 15 members.Airlines including Air Koryo and Air China Ltd offer less than 200,000 available seats a year in the North Korean market, according to a January note from independent research firm CAPA Centre for Aviation.That compares with over 13 million seats available in the South Korean market, which has roughly double the population, CAPA said.The biggest beneficiaries of lifting air restrictions over North Korea would be South Korean carriers including Korean Air Lines and Asiana Airlines Inc, according to CAPA.The United States has doubled down on sanctions enforcement ahead of the planned second summit amid concerns Pyongyang is not committed to denuclearisation, though Washington promised to relax some rules on humanitarian aid.South and North Korea, meanwhile, have rapidly advanced relations, which prompted US officials to openly warn against moving too quickly without sufficient progress on denuclearisation.A fourth source told Reuters that the US move to facilitate humanitarian aid was intended to appease South Korea, facing some complaints that Washington is not willing to make any concessions.“But they made it clear that there will be no relief of economic sanctions until they see substantial progress,” said the source who also spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue."
232,Pakistan’S Support To Terror To Be The Focus As Saudi Prince Set To Arrive In Delhi,"New Delhi: Pakistan’s support to terror and its involvement in Pulwama attack last week will be one of the focus as Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammad bin Salman visits India. He will be on a two-day India visit starting February 19th and 20th, after his visit to Pakistan.During his visit, bin Salman will be calling on President Ram Nath Kovind and will have bilateral talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This is the second meet between Prime Minister Modi and the Saudi prince in a span of 3 months.

Prince Salman said Saudi ‘cannot say no to Pakistan, whatever you (Pakistan) want we will do.’‘For Pakistanis, this is a great day,’ the Pakistani premier said while addressing a dinner reception held in honour of the visiting Saudi guests at the PM House.He said Saudi Arabia has always been there when Pakistan needed friends. ‘I want to thank you for the way you helped us when we were in (a) bad situation,’ Khan told the royal guest, adding that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were now taking their relationship to a new level, where investment agreements would be mutually beneficial for the countries.‘The future is exciting for both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia after joining hands,’ he said."
234,Reliance Group Reaches Agreement With 90% Of Lenders,"The Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group has reached an in-principle “standstill understanding” with more than 90 per cent of its lenders, the company said on Sunday.A Reliance Group statement said that as per the understanding reached, 90 per cent of its lenders will not enforce security and will not sell any of the shares pledged by the promoters till September 30, 2019, on account of lower collateral cover or reduced margin caused by recent unprecedented fall in share prices.The Anil Ambani Group will pay the principal and interest to the lenders as per the scheduled due dates specified in the loan agreements, it said. “We are grateful to our lenders for believing in the intrinsic and fundamental value of our companies, and granting their in-principle approval to standstill arrangements,” a Reliance Group spokesperson said.“The Reliance Group has also informed the lenders that it has appointed investment bankers to place a part of its direct 30 per cent shareholding in Reliance Power Ltd to target institutional investors.“Roadshows by the investment bankers will commence during the next week,” the statement said.Value of the promoter stake in Reliance Power, before the unprecedented fall in share prices, was more than Rs 2,500 crore, and would clear more than 65 per cent of the total promoter borrowings, it added. Earlier this month, the Reliance Group said a few non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), substantially L&amp;T Finance and certain entities of Edelweiss Group, have invoked the pledge on listed shares of the Group and made open market sales of the value of approximately Rs 400 crore during February 4-7.The market capitalisation of the three companies were badly impacted due to the open market sales. Reliance Infrastructure Ltd holds 40 per cent equity in Reliance Power and “even after placement of its holding by the promoters, majority stake and control remains with Anil Ambani Group”, the statement said.“Unlike Zee/Essel Group promoters – where there are about 25 lenders — the Anil Ambani Group has only nine lenders at promoter level. Some of the key lenders are — Templeton MF, DHFL Primeamerica MF, Indiabulls MF, IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank.“Also, unlike Zee/Essel Group promoters — where Indian Mutual funds have lent Rs 7,000 crore — the Anil Ambani Group has only Rs 1,000 crore borrowings from Indian mutual funds,” it added. According to Reliance, Franklin Templeton comprises 90 per cent of the mutual fund (MF) exposure, and has publicly supported the Anil Ambani Group promoters, saying: “In our view, the transaction remains adequately covered, and we continue to engage with ADA Group to decide the future course of action.”“Primeamerica MF and Indiabulls MF, with combined exposure less than Rs 100 crore, are being paid off in full before March 31, 2019,” the statement said."
235,Union Minister KJ Alphons Draws Flak Over His ‘Selfie’ At CRPF Jawan’S Funeral,"New Delhi, Feb 18: Days after Union Minister KJ Alphons’ ‘selfie’ at a Pulwama martyr’s funeral in Kerala’s Wayanad went viral, the Tourism Minister on Monday wrote to the Kerala DGP complaining that some miscreants circulated his photograph at the CRPF jawan’s funeral as a “selfie”.“Some person had taken my photographs standing near the coffin. My media secretary had put the same on my Facebook. Alleging that the photograph was a selfie taken by me, some miscreants had spread false news against me in the social media. The act of those miscreants reduced my reputation in the public, which is an offence punishable under the provisions of Indian Penal Code,” he wrote. “Unless these vicious criminal vultures are brought to book the integrity of the country and society will be at stake,” he wrote, requesting appropriate action against the culprits.Pulwama attack could not have been staged by one man alone: Former R&amp;AW chiefThe Union Minister attended the funeral ceremony of jawan Vasantha Kumar VV at his house in Kerala’s Wayanad district on Saturday. Vasantha was one of the 40 CRPF soldiers who lost their lives in the Pulwama suicide bombing on Thursday (February 14).Soon after his ‘selfie’ surfaced on social media, KJ Alphons received massive flak for his insensitive nature of photograph.As many as 40 CRPF personnel were killed and five injured on Thursday in one of the deadliest terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir when a Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying over 100 kg of explosives into their bus in Pulwama district."
236,"2 Kerala Youth Cong Workers Killed, Rahul Says Incident ‘Shocking’","Two Youth Congress workers were allegedly hacked to death by unidentified assailants in the northern district of Kasargod in Kerala on Sunday, 17 February, a senior police official said.The incident took place at around 8 pm and the deceased were identified as Kripesh and Sarath Lal (24), the official was quoted as saying by PTI.They were attacked by three assailants who came on motorcycles, he added.Police Official”Two youths have been killed.

He will visit families of the deceased workers on Monday.“The CPI(M) is trying to destroy the Congress party using the party goons,” he added.“The youth congress activists were attacked without any provocation. They were not involved in any kind of criminal activities. No cases were there against them. The government should identify the culprits and arrest them as soon as possible,” Chennithala told media persons.He also alleged that the murder was a conspiracy hatched by the CPI(M) as the Lok Sabha elections are around the corner.However, CPI(M) District Secretary MV Balakrishnan Master categorically denied any role of his party in the killings. “We strongly condemn this murder.

237,"Army Major Among 4 Martyred In Encounter, Days After Pulwama-Attack","Army Major among 4 martyred in encounter, days after Pulwama-attack Just days after a CRPF convoy was attacked in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir, four soldiers including an Army major were martyred in the area on Monday.The security forces launched an operation on the basis of intel about the presence of terrorists in Pulwama.In the overnight encounter, a civilian also died. The army personnel belonged to 55 Rashtriya Rifles.Here’s more.Security forces trapped terrorists in Pulwama’s village J&amp;K police, army, and paramilitary forces cordoned off Pinglana village in the district after learning that 2-3 terrorists were hiding in a house.As the forces tried to neutralize them, they started the gunfire. Initially, five army personnel were injured and were rushed to 92 Base Hospital in Srinagar.Four men among the injured succumbed to injuries.Gunfire resumed after hours of silence This encounter comes close to heels of the barbaric Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were martyred.On February 14, a terrorist named Adil Ahmad Dar rammed an explosive-laced vehicle into one of the buses of CRPF convoy triggering an intense blast.Adil belonged to Jaish-e-Mohammed and had joined the notorious terrorist outfit last year.

238,"Be Ready For Another Week Of Volatility, Choppy Markets","Markets were under pressure last week and lost on every single trading day. Considering that there were losses for five days, the cumulative amount was not that very large. BSE SENSEX lost 737.53 points or 2.02 per cent to close at 35,808.95 points. NIFTY was down 219.20 points or 2.00 per cent at 10,724.40 points. The broader market lost a little more with BSE100, BSE200 and BSE500 down 2.33 per cent, 2.26 per cent and 2.30 per cent down. The bigger pain continues to be in the mid and small cap which were down 2.71 per cent and 2.96 per cent respectively. BSEMIDCAP is less than 3 per cent away from making a new 52-week low while BSESMALLCAP is at a 52-week low. The problem with these small shares is that there seems to be no level at which they would stop. They seem to be just falling non-stop and there are no levels for support for these stocks. Dow Jones had a positive week and gained 776.92 points or 3.09 per cent to close at 25,883.25 points. The Indian rupee gained 8 paisa or 0.11 per cent to close at Rs 71.22.Results season is over and there have been some positive takeaways from them. Clearly, the auto sector and the ancillary makers have been under pressure with the largest auto maker Maruti seeing a slowdown. The impact of this is likely to remain for a couple of quarters.The terror attack on the CRPF by a suicide bomber in Jammu and Kashmir — the world has unitedly condemned the attack and asked Pakistan to take immediate action — has added to the political tension, with elections due in about two months. The window of new announcements and projects to be launched in the run-up to the election being notified is about three weeks away. Expect a slew of them as we get ready for the mother of all election which will be a watershed one. Many parties would be fighting this election for their survival and a poor showing this time around could be disastrous for their future. The knack with which market finds its weekly bogey stocks simply continues. This week it was the turn of Apollo Hospital and Emami which has a large portion of promoter shares being pledged. Emami lost Rs 24.90 during the week or 6.90 per cent after losing Rs 27.25 in the previous week to close at Rs 360.85. Apollo Hospital lost Rs 118 or 10.34 per cent to close at Rs 1,141. With promoter pledge becoming such a big concern, one is finding that shares seem to just tumble. The broader issue is that a large portion of this financing has been done by mutual funds and some of it by NBCs. The golden run of mutual funds which saw huge inflows through SIP post demonetization seems to have run its course and come to a complete halt. Live SIP accounts have fallen to 1.87 lakh accounts in December 2018 from 4.81 lakh accounts in April 2018. With the current state of the market being what it is, this situation is likely to worsen as returns are negative from the stock market.The week ahead is likely to see the market under pressure and test key support levels. There are multiple supports and we have about three to four major levels of support in a span of 300-350 points on the NIFTY. If these levels hold, it would be a reason for the markets to rebound. In case they fail, there could be some panic before value buying comes in. Brace yourself for yet another week of volatility and choppy markets."

240,Russia`s Gazprombank Freezes Accounts Of Venezuela`s PDVSA – Source,"MOSCOW – Russian lender Gazprombank has decided to freeze the accounts of Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA and halted transactions with the firm to reduce the risk of the bank falling under U.S. sanctions, a Gazprombank source told Reuters on Sunday.While many foreign firms have been cutting their exposure to PDVSA since the sanctions were imposed, the fact that a lender closely aligned with the Russian state is following suit is significant because the Kremlin has been among Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s staunchest supporters.“PDVSA’s accounts are currently frozen. As you’ll understand, operations cannot be carried out,” the source said. Gazprombank did not reply to a Reuters request for a comment.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_2_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_2_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 280px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: visible;""><iframe id=""aswift_2"" name=""aswift_2"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=3529274730&amp;adf=2650424732&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.3~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615634079&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Frussias-gazprombank-freezes-accounts-of-venezuelas-pdvsa-source%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615634079938&amp;bpp=3&amp;bdt=1257&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D3f02dc721d498d4b-228acfd0e0c600f4%3AT%3D1615634074%3ART%3D1615634074%3AS%3DALNI_MYYhDCopdRkWX9GIjaEcKSsHZWnlg&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280&amp;nras=3&amp;correlator=2111911649870&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1129950004.1615634072&amp;ga_sid=1615634079&amp;ga_hid=1806369121&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=3&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1392&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=42530672%2C44737537%2C44737563%2C31060427&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=2369965870572859&amp;pem=640&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=3&amp;uci=a!3&amp;btvi=1&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=FWTN64mTKo&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=27"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!3"" data-google-query-id=""COvxp_yRre8CFfJ_0wodq9kAiA"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
Reuters reported this month that PDVSA was telling customers of its joint ventures to deposit oil sales proceeds in its Gazprombank accounts, according to sources and an internal document, in a move to try to sideline fresh U.S. sanctions on PDVSA.Washington says the sanctions, imposed on Jan. 28, are aimed at blocking Maduro’s access to the country’s oil revenue after opposition leader Juan Guaido proclaimed himself interim president and received widespread Western support.Gazprombank is Russia’s third biggest lender by assets and includes among its shareholders Russian state gas company Gazprom.The bank has held PDVSA accounts for several years. In 2013, PDVSA said it signed a deal with Gazprombank for $1 billion in financing for the Petrozamora company. The source said that Petrozamora accounts were frozen, too.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 280px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: visible;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=3529274730&amp;adf=1358497946&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.11~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615634079&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Frussias-gazprombank-freezes-accounts-of-venezuelas-pdvsa-source%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615634079938&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=1256&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D3f02dc721d498d4b-228acfd0e0c600f4%3AT%3D1615634074%3ART%3D1615634074%3AS%3DALNI_MYYhDCopdRkWX9GIjaEcKSsHZWnlg&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=2111911649870&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1129950004.1615634072&amp;ga_sid=1615634079&amp;ga_hid=1806369121&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=3&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2048&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=42530672%2C44737537%2C44737563%2C31060427&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=2369965870572859&amp;pem=640&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=pYw3yfl374&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=35"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CNGKqvyRre8CFcnS3godueECgw"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
Russian officials have said they stand by Maduro and have condemned opposition actions as a U.S.-inspired ploy to usurp power in Caracas.But Russian firms find themselves in a quandary, caught between a desire to endorse the Kremlin line and back Maduro, and the fear that by doing so they could expose themselves to secondary U.S. sanctions which would harm their businesses."

242,"FinMin To Take Up Demands To RBI On PCA, Interim Dividend, SME Loan Easing","The Finance Ministry will take up the issue of dividend and Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) and easing of SME loan norms by public sector banks banks with the RBI when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will address the Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank on Monday in his first meeting after the Interim Budget.There will be discussions on these three issues with RBI. The Ministry will seek alignment of capital norms with Basel III, informed sources said.Indian banks as per RBI directions are required to maintain 5.5 per cent Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) as against 4.5 per cent required under the Basel III framework. Currently, the RBI applies stricter norms and not those specified under Basel III for capital adequacy, leading banks to set aside higher capital for loans. The government has been in favour of alignment of the capital adequacy norms with Basel III norms. This higher capital norms translate into additional capital requirement, restricting lending potential and income generation, the sources said.Many of the RBI’s Indian framework on banking capital regulatory rules are more conservative than the Basel framework. This includes higher minimum capital requirements and risk weightings for certain types of exposures as well as higher minimum capital ratios. The RBI also applies certain restrictions to banking activities through its prudential framework. This needs to change. If RBI relaxes the norms, around Rs 6 lakh crore of lending can be achieved without any additional requirement for provisioning, said the sources.With three banks out of Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) and two banks set to be out of PCA by default, of the 11 banks six remain the restrictive framework. The government wants the capital norms to be relaxed. RBI may have already tweaked the RoA or return on assets norms which allowed Bank of Maharashtra, Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce to come of PCA framework.Currently, banks having negative RoA for two-four consecutive years are brought under PCA framework. Under the PCA framework, the regulatory trigger points in terms of three parameters – capital to risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR), net non-performing assets (NPA) which are taken care of through recapitalistaion of banks by the government.The Finance Ministry wants formal commitment on Rs 28,000 crore interim dividend. If the central board of RBI agrees to pay Rs 28,000 crore as interim dividend, total surplus transfer to the government would be Rs 68,000 crore in the current fiscal. RBI has already paid Rs 40,000 crore.Last month, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said the central bank was yet to take a decision on dividend. So far RBI has not indicated anything but its audit board had taken up the matter recently. The RBI, which follows the July-June fiscal year, has already transferred Rs 40,000 crore in the current fiscal. In order to enhance bank lending to MSMEs, the Finance Ministry will seek easing certain ‘risk-weight’ guidelines for lending to MSMEs and align them to globally accepted benchmarks. Globally accepted benchmark of a maximum of 75 per cent risk weight for smaller companies as compared with present 150 per cent risks weight for both rated and unrated MSME loans."

244,Rishabh Pant Discloses How Kiran More Improved His Keeping After Tough England Tour,"New Delhi: A slight tweak in hand positioning and body posture was all that it took for Rishabh Pant to turn the tables after a tough stint behind the stumps in England and the fast-rising Indian wicketkeeper-batsman credits Kiran More for making it happen.He faced sharp criticism for his wicket-keeping skills in adverse English conditions but Pant more than made up for it in Australia.In England, where the red Dukes was seaming all around, a lot of byes were recorded against Pant’s name, many of them due to the ball moving in the air even after leaving the stumps.However, things changed in Australia, where he pulled off 20 catches with a world record-equalling 11 scalps in Adelaide.“Keeping in England was an altogether different experience. After that, I worked with Kiran sir at the NCA on a few specific areas. It included hand-positioning and body posture. Every keeper has distinct movement and I tweaked it a little and it worked,” Pant told PTI during an exclusive interview.While Pant didn’t elaborate on the specifics, More, who has been a respected coach as well as former chairman of the national selection committee, pointed out a few basic areas.“Rishabh had a more sideways movement and I suggested a bit more open chested stance. It helps in balance and keeping a still head, something that is key to Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s success,” More said.About the positioning of hands, More said, “I advised a very minor change like pointing the finger towards ground rather than the bowler. It helps one avoid injuries and success in taking catches goes up.”For Pant, the endeavour is to improve everyday and working on his glovework is a part of that process.“When you make it to the team at a young age, the more you are keen to learn, the better you get at utilising the opportunities that come your way,” the 21 year old said.The turning point for him was certainly the hundred at the Oval which gave him confidence and it’s effect showed in Australia where he was phenomenal both behind as well as in front of the stumps.“When I got that hundred in England, the confidence rose to a different level. From there, I started constantly thinking that how can I improve in certain areas. The process of learning that started in England paid off in Australia,” said the heir apparent of Dhoni.The ‘devil-may-care’ approach to batting has been his calling card and he asserts that the high stakes IPL games, where he plays for Delhi Capitals, and for India, have not bogged him down.But isn’t there and insecurity that this approach may let him down when stakes are very high?“Insecurities will always be there whether you play for India or for your franchise in IPL. But how do you beat those insecurities and perform, defines you as a player.”“Stakes will always be high for India or Delhi Capitals, so if you let insecurities come in your way, it will be very difficult to focus on the job. One needs that balance to treat every game as same,” said Pant.Having scored 684 runs in the last IPL season for Delhi (erstwhile Daredevils), Pant obviously wants a repeat and would prefer batting at the top of the order for the Capitals.“As a batsman, I would always like to bat as high as possible but the team combination is also very important,” said Pant, who expects things to change for Delhi this time round.“We have had a change in name, jersey and New players have come in. It’s a good blend of youth and experience. Hope both our departments click this time and Delhi Capitals have a good tourney.”With 277,000 followers on Twitter, Pant’s fan following is on the rise but for him it’s a by-product of his success on the field and nothing more than that.As a young celebrity, he provided his perspective on how social media can cut both ways.“You need to be careful about social media. Once you are well known, your personal space shrinks. You will get a lot of praise but one should also be aware that you will have to deal with negativity,” he said.“Irrespective of social media’s influence, it’s the cricket that you play which will remain paramount. How to keep focus when you have hit a low patch and things are looking down, is something we all must learn,” he concluded."
245,Romania Stun Champions Czech Republic,"Romania reached the Fed Cup semifinals for the first time on Sunday with a 3-2 win over defending champions Czech Republic as Irina-Camelia Begu and Monica Niculescu stunned Wimbledon and French Open winners Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova in a marathon doubles decider.Begu and Niculescu triumphed 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 6-4 in a thrilling rubber in Ostrava which lasted just seven minutes short of three hours.Krejcikova and Siniakova, the world’s leading pair, trailed a break early in the final set before hitting back to 4-4. But the Romanian pair broke straight back for 5-4 before Begu, ranked at 35 in doubles, served out the tie.The result ended the 10-time champions Czechs’ hopes of making the Fed Cup semifinals for an 11th successive year and represented their first home defeat in a decade.Earlier Simona Halep won the battle of the former world number ones with an epic 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 triumph over Karolina Pliskova, the Czechs’ highest-ranked player in the absence of world number three Petra Kvitova.“I am happy to have won against such a tough opponent,” said Halep after winning her second singles of the weekend. “It was my best and biggest win in the Fed Cup.”Siniakova, who won both her singles rubbers in the 2018 final triumph over the United States, pulled the Czechs level by seeing off Mihaela Buzarnescu 6-4, 6-2.French Open champion Halep had said that winning a first Fed Cup for Romania was now the top priority on her “bucket list” having finally broken her Grand Slam drought in Paris last year.Romania will now travel to France in April’s semifinals while the other last-four clash sees Belarus up against either the United States or Australia.In Liege, Caroline Garcia crowned her comeback from a two-year Fed Cup exile by leading France past Belgium and into a fourth semifinal in five years.French number one Garcia brushed aside Belgium’s top player Elise Mertens 6-2, 6-3 to follow her opening day three-set win over Alison Van Uytvanck. Her win gave two-time champions France an unassailable 3-0 lead in the tie before Belgium grabbed a consolation point in the dead doubles rubber.“Two years is not that long in a tennis career,” said Garcia who opted out of the Fed Cup in 2017 following an ugly public spat with her teammates.“But I always said that I would come back and that it was important to me.”At Asheville in North Carolina, Ashleigh Barty notched up a 10th successive win in the tournament by seeing off Madison Keys 6-4, 6-1 to give Australia a 2-1 lead over 18-time champions the United States.Danielle Collins then levelled the tie when the Australian Open semi-finalist, making her Fed Cup debut, saw off Daria Gavrilova 6-1, 3-6, 6-2.Belarus coasted into the semifinals when world number nine Aryna Sabalenka defeated Laura Siegemund 6-1, 6-1 for an unassailable 3-0 lead over Germany in Braunschweig.“I am so happy and our team is so happy. It’s unbelievable to win,” said the 20-year-old Sabalenka who dropped just five games in four sets all weekend.The semifinals take place on the weekend of April 20-21."
246,Sunil Gavaskar Tells Why Team India Are Not Top Contenders For ICC World Cup 2019,"Former Indian skipper Sunil Gavaskar feels that the English cricket team is the most favourite to win the ICC World Cup 2019. Gavaskar also stated that the English team have become a formidable One Day International (ODI) side since the 2015 World Cup, where they were knocked out in the league stage.“The strong favourites in the World Cup tournament are England. And it is not because of the fact that it will be a home World Cup for them. But because they have changed their attitude towards ODI cricket. They had lost in the league stage in 2015 World Cup, probably against Bangladesh. But since then, the manner in which they changed their game, the way in which they picked their team, England have grown into a strong side. They have a good opening pair, they have strong middle-order batters, they also have good all-rounders and when you play at home you also have a strong backing,” Gavaskar was quoted as saying to India Today.However, Gavaskar also insisted that Team India have the advantage of having played in English condition in the last two years – 2017 and 2018. The former batting great also said that Virat Kohli and Co are the second most favourites to win the quadrennial event.“The advantage that India have is they have played in England for two consecutive years – 2017 and 2018. So, the players, who will be part of the World Cup squad, will be aware of the conditions and hence will be able to use their experience and probably India can use the factor to lift the World Cup. But I feel the most favourites are England and then come India,” Gavaskar said."
247,Pulwama Attack: Virender Sehwag Offers To Sponsor Education Expenses Of Martyrs’ Children,"New Delhi: Former India cricketer Virender Sehwag Saturday offered to bear the educational expenses of children of all the CRPF personnel martyred in the dastardly terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama. On Thursday, at least 40 CRPF paramilitary troopers were killed in a terror attack while several others are battling for their lives following what is being termed as the deadliest terrorist strike in three decades in the valley.“Nothing we can do will be enough, but the least I can do is offer to take complete care of the education of the children of our brave CRPF jawans martyred in #Pulwama in my Sehwag International School @SehwagSchool, Jhajjar. Saubhagya Hoga,” Sehwag wrote on his twitter handle. Star boxer Vijender Singh, who is employed with Haryana Police, is donating a month’s salary.“I’m donating my one month’s salary for the martyrs of #PulwamaTerrorAttack and want everyone to come forward and support the families. It is our moral duty to always standby them and make them feel proud of their sacrifices. Jai Hind,” the Olympic medallist said.An explosive-laden SUV rammed into one of the buses in the CRPF convoy at Awantipora town in the Pulwama district. Condolence messages have been pouring in for the family of the deceased soldiers since the news of the attack broke out.Condemning the terror attack, the big-hitting former India opener had earlier tweeted, “Really pained by the cowardly attack on our CRPF in J&amp;K in which our brave men have been martyred. No words are enough to describe the pain. I wish a speedy recovery to those injured.”"
248,Linking Aadhaar-PAN Is Mandatory For Tax Filers: CBDT,"The CBDT has stressed that Aadhaar-PAN linking is “mandatory” for those filing an Income Tax Return (ITR) and this procedure has to be “completed” by 31 March this year.“Constitutional validity of Aadhaar has been upheld by the Supreme Court of India in September 2018. Consequently, in terms of Section 139AA of Income Tax Act, 1961 and order dated 30 June 2018 of the Central Board of Direct Taxes, Aadhaar-PAN linking is mandatory now which has to be completed till 31 March 2019 by PAN holders requiring filing of ITR,” the CBDT said in an advisory on Thursday, 14 February. The Supreme Court on 6 February had confirmed that linkage of PAN with Aadhaar is mandatory for filing of ITRs.CBDT Chief Sushil Chandra Appointed as Election CommissionerThis reiteration of the September order of the apex court came on an appeal filed by the Centre against a Delhi High Court order allowing two persons, to file their ITRs for 2018-19 without linking their Aadhaar and PAN numbers.A bench comprising Justices A K Sikri and S Abdul Nazeer said the top court has already decided the matter and upheld the section 139AA of the Income Tax Act.The apex court on 26 September last year had declared the Centre’s flagship Aadhaar scheme as constitutionally valid but struck down some of its provisions including its linking with bank accounts, mobile phones and school admissions.Linkage of PAN with Aadhaar Is Mandatory for Filing IT Return: SC‘Easier to Find Assesse’s Spending Pattern’Former CBDT Chairman Sushil Chandra, early this month at an event, had said that just 23 crore PAN card holders– over half of the total PAN card holders — have so far linked their cards with biometric ID Aadhaar.He had said the I-T Department has so far issued 42 crore permanent account numbers (PAN), of which 23 crore have been linked with Aadhaar.Chandra said that once Aadhaar is linked with PAN and PAN is linked with bank account, the I-T department can find out spending pattern and other details of the assessee.Also since many agencies are linked with Aadhaar, it would be easier to gauge whether the benefits of welfare schemes are availed by eligible persons, he said.Section 139 AA (2) of the Income Tax Act says that every person having PAN as on 1 July 2017, and eligible to obtain Aadhaar, must intimate his Aadhaar number to tax authorities.While Aadhaar is issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to a resident of India, PAN is a 10-digit alphanumeric number allotted by the IT Department to a person, firm or entity.The CBDT formulates policy for the tax department."
249,"Curfew To Continue In Jammu, Authorities To Take Call In Evening After Assessing Situation","Curfew imposed in Jammu and Kashmir was not relaxed on Saturday two days after 40 CRPF personnel were martyred in a suicide attack on the Jammu-Srinagar highway in Pulwama by a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist, although authorities claim the situation was under control.Jammu DC Ramesh Kumar said that after assessing the situation the administration and authorities will take a call by evening on the curfew extension.“Curfew was imposed yesterday, no casualties were reported. The situation is under control but as a precautionary measure, we have continued with the curfew. We will decide whether to continue it or not by evening, after assessing the situation,” said DC Ramesh Kumar.The mobile internet suspension started on Friday.Speed of fixedline broadband connections have also been slashed to prevent any form of amplification of the situation given the fact that anti-social elements could upload inflammatory pictures and comments on social media to disrupt peace in the city.Curfew was imposed on Friday when miscreants torched and damaged several vehicles that carried registration numbers belonging to the Kashmir region.The Army was immediately called out to assist the civil administration to restore order in the city.Curfew was initially imposed in some vulnerable areas, but was later extended to the entire city as tension mounted in the wake of violence against a particular section of the society.The authorities met with important citizens belonging to different communities on Friday to seek their help in bringing the city back to normal."
250,Twitter Doesn’T Remove Direct Messages Even When You Delete Them,"Twitter doesn’t remove direct messages even when you delete them In a major surprise, a security researcher has discovered Twitter doesn’t really remove direct messages from its servers even when you delete them.Karan Saini downloaded the archived data for his account and found that the company has been storing deleted DMs dating years back.So, if you’ve been thinking your DMs are gone for good, you’re probably wrong.Here’s more on the issue.Years-old deleted direct messages accessed When you delete a DM, the idea is that the message goes away from your side of the conversation as well as from Twitter’s servers.So, technically, if both parties engaged in a conversation delete DMs, they should go away completely from the company’s servers.But, Saini discovered that’s not the case; deleted messages can be accessed through a file in archived Twitter data.Plus, data from deactivated accounts can also be accessed Along with deleted messages, Saini also found that DMs sent to and from accounts that have been suspended and deactivated can also be accessed, TechCrunch reported.This is in stark contrast of Twitter’s policy which claims once an account has been deleted and deactivated, the account in question and the data associated with it is removed permanently after a 30-day-long grace period.Twitter is looking into the matter Though the issue is not major because deleted DMs can only be accessed by the parties involved in the conversation, it does raise some concerns.Saini maintained it is a “functional bug” and not a security flaw.Meanwhile, Twitter has acknowledged the issue and said it is “looking into this further to ensure we have considered the entire scope of the issue.”Twitter, too, has been marred by bugs Lately, Twitter has been dealing with several bugs. First, it is the message spoofing issue that let anyone send tweets via mobile; then it was the bug that made protected tweets public for several users, and now, there’s this issue."
251,Railways To Produce Set Of 100 Train 18s,"The Railways will produce a set of 100 Train 18s to run on semi-high speed routes across the country, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said on Friday.The minister was speaking in Train 18, which was rechristened as Vande Bharat Express. The train was on an inaugural journey from New Delhi to Varanasi.“PM Narendra Modi asked the Railways to produce 100 more Train 18s and for producing 30 trains, tender has been finalised,” he said.Manufacturing of Train 18 with indigenous technology is a success of Make In India programme, the minister said.The minister also said that all railway tracks on the Golden Quadrilateral routes would be upgraded with better infrastructure to enable trains to run at a speed of 160 km per hour."
252,"Snags Fixed, Vande Bharat Express Commercial Run On Schedule","A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged off the Delhi-Varanasi Vande Bharat Express, the first engine-less semi-high speed train developed snags on its way back to Delhi on Saturday and had to halt twice. The unexpected development cast a shadow on its regular operations that was to begin on Sunday, 17 February, but railway sources said the Vande Bharat Express commercial run was on schedule.After reaching Varanasi around 9.45 pm on Friday on its inaugural run, the train left for Delhi at 10.30 pm the same night. Trouble started Saturday morning, and the train first stopped near Tundla Junction in Uttar Pradesh around 6.30 am. It remained stuck there for around a couple of hours.Stating that there was a “possible cattle run over”, the railway sources told The Statesman that tripping was caused by the flesh of the dead animal.| Day after launch, fastest train Vande Bharat Express breaks down on way back to DelhiIn an official statement later, Indian Railway spokesperson Smita Vats Sharma said: “This disruption appears to be because of a possible cattle run over. The train was returning at night and cattle run over is a possibility at odd times.”Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and Railway Board Chairman Vinod Yadav travelled along with mediapersons during the inaugural run of Vande Bharat Express, which covered a distance of 760 km from Delhi to Varanasi. Other senior railway officials were also on board.These mediapersons were on board the train on its return journey. Those travelling in the train said power went out in some coaches around 5 am, and the train was running at a sluggish pace before coming to a halt near Tundla around 6.30 am.“It was a case of skidding wheels after the train ran over cattle,” Northern Railway CPRO Deepak Kumar said.The train resumed its journey to Delhi around 8.15 am after all obstructions were removed, officials said.However, after running for 40 minutes at a slower speed, Train 18 suffered a breakdown again at Hathras Junction.According to reports, the brakes of the train had jammed, which were fixed at Hathras. Vande Bharat Express finally resumed its journey to Delhi around 10:30 am, and was able to attain speeds of 100 km per hour.The Railway Ministry later confirmed the train had reached Delhi, and was ready for its commercial run.“India’s First Semi High Speed train Vande Bharat Express completed its inaugural trip to Varanasi and returned back to New Delhi. Looking forward to its regular run from tomorrow,” the ministry tweeted.The train is overbooked for its first commercial run, according to the Railways.Manufactured by the Integral Coach Factory, Chennai, Vande Bharat Express had hit 180 kmph speed levels during a trial run on a section of the Delhi-Mumbai Rajdhani route. On the Delhi-Varanasi section, however, it will run at a maximum of 130 kmph speeds."

Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale had a meeting with China’s ambassador to India, Luo Zhaohui, on Friday and conveyed to him that New Delhi had clinching evidence to prove that the suicide attack on the CRPF personnel at Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir had been carried out by the JeM – an anti-India terror outfit based in Pakistan.Gokhale also told Luo that Islamabad had given “full freedom” to Masood Azhar to operate and expand the JeM’s terror infrastructure in Pakistan.Beijing, however, reiterated its old stand on the move to impose international sanctions on Azhar and declined to commit support to any fresh move by New Delhi or any other nations against him at the United Nations Security Council.However, in a letter to his counterpart External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, China’s State Councillor and Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, condemned the suicide attack, expressed deep sympathy to families of the victims and stressed that Chinese Government resolutely opposed all forms of terrorism.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=2229867560&amp;adf=3778027136&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.9~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615634202&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fchina-will-not-back-india-bid-to-sanction-jem%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615634202462&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=893&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3Dfa861923fd957a37-22d69080ddc600ba%3AT%3D1615634172%3ART%3D1615634172%3AS%3DALNI_MZQm1UC14qIGDidQ1wAyfjmAqDbaQ&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=3744968557040&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=2096174742.1615634169&amp;ga_sid=1615634202&amp;ga_hid=1494197304&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=6&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2047&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=21068083%2C21068945%2C31060351&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=1419287958649131&amp;pem=300&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=6S74qkd8TU&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=14"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CNmE3baSre8CFY1u0wodhr4DKQ"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
“We firmly oppose and strongly condemn all forms of terrorism,” Geng Shuang, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Chinese Government, told journalists in Beijing. “We hope relevant regional countries will cooperate to cope with the threat of terrorism and jointly uphold regional peace and stability”.He, however, made it clear that China would not change its policy on anti-India terrorists based in Pakistan.New Delhi has been trying to get JeM chief Masood Azhar designated as an international terrorist by the United Nations. All individuals and entities listed by the 1267/1989/2253 ISIL (Da’esh) and Al Qaida Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council are subjected to international sanctions, including travel restrictions and measures curbing financial transactions.

“As for the issue of listing, I could tell you that the 1267 Committee of Security Council has a clear stipulation on the listing and procedure of the terrorist organisations,” Geng said, reiterating Chinese Government’s old stand on the issue. “(The) JeM has been included in the Security Council terrorism sanctions list. China will continue to handle the relevant sanctions issue in a constructive and responsible manner.”India and China had a series of engagements throughout 2018 seeking to mend the bilateral ties, which had hit a new low over the 72-day-long military face-off at Doklam Plateau in western Bhutan in June-August 2017. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping had an “informal summit” at Wuhan in central China on April 27 and 28 last year. The “informal summit” resulted in a thaw in bilateral relations. They also had three other meeting on the sideline of multilateral events after the “informal summit” in Wuhan. During their last meeting on the sideline of the G20 summit at Buenos Aires, Modi and Xi had noted that 2018 had been a good year for India-China relations and hoped that 2019 would be even better.Notwithstanding the bonhomie between Modi and Xi, China on Friday made it clear that it would not change its policy of shielding Pakistan-based anti-India terrorists from international sanctions."

The President’s plan was announced after the Congress refused to pay for a wall. California Governor Gavin Newsom, meanwhile, announced plans to sue the Trump administration after the President’s move for a national emergency to access funds for building the wall on the Mexican border was made public.Trump had already anticipated that he would be sued for the move and predicted that the emergency order would lead to legal action which was likely to end up in the Supreme Court.Within hours, the first legal challenge against the declaration of national emergency was launched. A liberal advocacy group, Public Citizen, sued on behalf of a nature preserve and three Texas landowners who have been told the wall may be constructed on their properties.The emergency declaration will give Donald Trump access to billions of dollars for his project. The President said the emergency would allow him to get almost $8 billion for the wall.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_4"" name=""aswift_4"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:200px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""200"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=200&amp;adk=3089905333&amp;adf=807345960&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.11~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615634255&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x200&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fdonald-trump-defends-emergency-move-over-mexico-wall-as-california-decides-to-sue-him%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615634255440&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=919&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3Dfa861923fd957a37-22d69080ddc600ba%3AT%3D1615634172%3ART%3D1615634172%3AS%3DALNI_MZQm1UC14qIGDidQ1wAyfjmAqDbaQ&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280%2C699x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=5&amp;correlator=273704618635&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=2096174742.1615634169&amp;ga_sid=1615634255&amp;ga_hid=1129189766&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=12&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2321&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=44737537%2C44736525%2C21066428&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=211092922287757&amp;pem=300&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=5&amp;uci=a!5&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=ONJvFkpJdq&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=33"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!5"" data-google-query-id=""CKbu-8-Sre8CFak3rQYd4QME7Q"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
The money is expected to be diverted from military construction projects and efforts to fight the drugs trade.This is still considerably short of the estimated $23 billion cost of the wall along almost 3,200 kilometres of the US-Mexico border.Building the wall was a key pledge of Trump’s campaign in 2016. The Democrats have described the move as a “gross abuse of power” ahead of the 2020 election."
260,AI Helping Differently-Abled To Become More Independent: Microsoft,"Cloud and Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions are empowering differently-abled people with tools that support independence and productivity, a top Microsoft executive said here on Friday.The software giant last year launched its five-year, $25 million “AI for Accessibility” programme that harnesses the power of AI to amplify human capability for the more than one billion people around the world with a disability. “At Microsoft, we believe there are no limits to what people can achieve when technology reflects the diversity of everyone who uses it,” Sriram Rajamani, Managing Director, Microsoft Research India, said on the inaugural day of the two-day “Accessibility Summit – Empowering for Inclusion” here. Real time speech-to-text transcription, computer vision capabilities and predictive text functionality are just a few examples of how AI is useful to people with disabilities. Inaugurating the summit, Shakuntala Doley Gamlin, Secretary, Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities at the Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry, said that a strong public-private partnership can go a long way in empowering the differently-abled with equal access and opportunity.Microsoft hosted the summit in collaboration with the National Association of the Deaf and National Centre for Promotion of Employment of Disabled People (NCPEPD), a non-profit organisation. The two-day conference will also combine a rich mix of master classes and access to Microsoft’s “AI for Accessibility” resources for the developer community with a showcase of inclusive technology, Microsoft said.The showcase will feature technology-based projects from non-profit organisations, assistive technologies developed by leading technology companies, Microsoft partners as well as Microsoft solutions, the company added."
261,"Pulwama: CRPF Wanted Air Transit For Attacked Convoy, Was Ignored","“We are concerned about our safety in the Valley. Travel between Jammu and Kashmir involves too much risk, why couldn’t CRPF jawans be transported by air or in bulletproof buses?”A grieving CRPF jawan told The Quint on the condition of anonymity after the fidayeen attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama, Jammu &amp; Kashmir on 14 February which killed 40 jawans. The convoy comprised over 2,500 CRPF personnel travelling in 78 vehicles.It turns out the CRPF had indeed requested air transit for the jawans to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) earlier this week. However, the request was ignored. Senior CRPF official to The Quint”A lot of jawans got stranded in Jammu because of roadblocks due to snowfall. Last convoy movement happened on 4 February. Hence, we wrote to our CRPF headquarters requesting them to provide us facilities to transit jawans by air. But nothing happened. No one bothered to reply to us.”After the senior official, posted in Srinagar, wrote to the CRPF headquarters, as per procedure the request was forwarded to the MHA.He further added that earlier also requests were made to transit jawans by air. But they had never been accepted.Senior CRPF officer”Transit of jawans by air would not only ensure their safety but it will be much faster and cost-effective.”Intelligence Had Inputs on ‘Use of IEDs’ 6 days before AttackA letter was written by the Intelligence Bureau on 8 February to top CPRF officials saying “please sanitise the area properly, as there are inputs of use of IEDs” in the Valley.But the intelligence note does not provide any specific details on the type of attack or the place and date.Retired IGP, CRPF VPS Panwar, who had been a convoy commander in the Valley, told The Quint that an attack like this shows complete security failure and that it seems the senior officials ignored intelligence inputs.“The need of the hour is that the CRPF should be provided with bulletproof vehicles and arrangements should be made for their transit by air, especially when so many jawans get stranded during winters.”VPS Panwar, retired IGP, CRPFGenerally, a convoy doesn’t comprise more than 300-400 jawans and the days of the movement of the convoy is also decided beforehand, he further added.“Movement of 78 vehicles in a convoy was like a sitting duck for the terrorists. I feel transporting so many jawans together was not a correct decision.”VPS Panwar, retired IGP, CRPFAdil Ahmad Dar is a 22-year-old, who lived just 10 kilometres away from spot of the Pulwama attack.How did the vehicle, carrying around 200 kgs of explosives, manage to reach the convoy? Wasn’t there enough security for the jawans who were returning from their homes?Here are the answers to these questions by CRPF officials.The convoy of 78 vehicles with over 2,500 CRPF men started at around 3:30 am on Thursday morning.Road Opening Party (ROP) was provided to the convoy from Jammu to Srinagar by the CRPF and Army.Traffic for civil vehicles remains open during convoy movement. Civil vehicles are not stopped while convoy passes any stretch and are even allowed to overtake and come in between security force’s vehicles if required.On reaching vulnerable places additional bulletproof vehicles are attached with the convoy as a countermeasure for any firing or ambush attempt by militants which remains the main threat in the region.The buses which are used for the jawans transportation have thin metallic plates which offer no protection from bullets or IEDs.ROP clear the road for any IED planted therein. Only after clearance from ROP, convoy moves through that area.In this case, the militant entered the highway from a link-road (from Lakapora-Lelhar side) and was moving on the left side. The moment the CRPF convoy was on its right, he triggered the explosive-laden vehicle which hit the no 5 and 6 buses in the row.Transporting the jawans by air will not only solve the above security loopholes and be faster, “it is also cost-effective although it shouldn’t be a concern for the government”, said the senior CRPF official."

“The United States calls on Pakistan to end immediately the support and safe haven provided to all terrorist groups operating on its soil, whose only goal is to sow chaos, violence, and terror in the region,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a late night statement on Thursday.“This attack only strengthens our resolve to bolster counterterrorism cooperation and coordination between the United States and India,” she said in a strongly-worded statement issued by the White House.Sanders said the United States condemns in the strongest terms the heinous terrorist attack in Pulwama by a Pakistan-based terrorist group.“We express our deep condolences to the victims’ families, the Indian government, and the Indian people for the loss of life in this brutal attack,” said the Press Secretary of President Donald Trump.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
Several US lawmakers also expressed solidarity with India in the wake of a dastardly terror attack and said the two countries stand united in condemning and defeating terror.Cutting across party lines, over 50 Congressmen and Senators took to social media to express their solidarity with the people of India and called for strict action against the JeM terror outfit and its state sponsors.“I strongly condemn the terror attack in Kashmir. The United States stands with our friends in India, and I send heartfelt condolences to the families that lost loved ones,” top Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer tweeted.Democratic Senator Robert Menendez said he was outraged by the terror attack, “one of the deadliest in the region since 1989”.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
Republican Senator Johnny Isakson strongly criticised the terror strike and pledged the US’ support to India in defeating terrorism.“Today, more than 40 Indian military police were killed by a radical Islamist terrorist group in the deadliest attack in 30 years on Indian forces in Kashmir. I send my deepest condolences to the soldiers injured and killed in this senseless attack, to their families, and to India, a critical ally in the global war on terror,” said Republican Senator John Cornyn, Co-Chair of Senate India caucus.“My heart is with the victims of the Kashmir Terror Attack. The United States stands with our Indian allies against those behind this heinous act of terrorism,” Democratic Senator Mark Warner, who is co-chair of the Senate India Caucus and Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, posted on Twitter.Congresswoman and Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard said, “We stand with the people of India in condemning the terrorist attack in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, and send our condolences and prayers to the victims families. We must all stand up against these jihadists and their ideology.”“Heartbreaking. My thoughts are with the families of the victims of heinous terrorist attacks in Jammu and Kashmir today. We must confront terror and defeat it, wherever it occurs,” Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal said.Democratic Congressman Eliot Engel, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said countries must not allow terrorist groups like JeM to operate with impunity.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>

265,Brexit: Prime Minister May Defeated By Parliament Again,"London: Prime Minister Theresa May suffered a defeat on her Brexit strategy on Thursday that undermined her pledge to European Union (EU) leaders to get her divorce deal approved if they grant her concessions.In a show of muscle, hardline Brexit supporters in her Conservative Party decided to abstain, handing her an embarrassing, albeit symbolic, defeat as she tries to renegotiate her deal with the EU.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_2_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_2_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
While it will not deter May from trying to secure changes on the most contentious issue of the deal – the Irish ‘backstop’ – the vote does show that her pro-Brexit lawmakers are a major obstacle to passing any agreement.May was absent from the House of Commons for the debate and the outcome of the vote, which deepened the sense of political crisis over Britain’s departure, more than two years after voters opted to leave the bloc by a margin of 52% to 48.The crunch vote is now expected to come on February 27, when May is due to return to parliament – and lawmakers who fear leaving without a deal could try to seize control of Britain’s departure from the EU.Deal, no deal, no Brexit?The latest twist in the two-year negotiation to leave the EU underlines the rifts in parliament over how, or even whether, Britain should leave the bloc, its biggest political and trade policy shift in more than 40 years.It increases the possibility of Britain leaving without a deal, a nightmare scenario for many businesses, but also of Brexit being delayed or potentially never happening at all.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
May’s spokesman said she still believed parliament wanted her to keep pressing for changes to the Brexit deal: ‘The government will continue to pursue this with the EU to ensure we leave on time on March 29.’EU leaders, meanwhile, have repeatedly said there can be no substantive change to the legally binding withdrawal agreement containing the backstop, a guarantee that there can be no return of border controls between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland.With trust in the prime minister at an all-time low, one Conservative pro-Brexit lawmaker said the government could no longer ignore eurosceptics’ views.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
‘While the vote might not be of substantive importance, what it does do is to tell the government that they really can’t take Brexiteers for granted,’ the lawmaker said on condition of anonymity.With many Conservative lawmakers abstaining, the government defeat on its motion reaffirming support for May’s strategy was a heavy one, at 303 votes to 258.Running down the clock?The pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), several dozen strong, had said they would defy May unless she dispelled their concern that she might, after all, baulk at a no-deal exit.Ministers were keen to shrug off the defeat.‘The fact that ERG colleagues abstain is sending a message that they still want to find a way forward and find a solution,’ said Robert Buckland, the solicitor general.ERG members say ruling out a no-deal Brexit would not only weaken Britain’s negotiating hand but also remove what, for many, is the desired end-point: the cleanest possible break.But some Conservative and many opposition lawmakers accuse May of ‘running down the clock’, edging Britain closer to the exit date to try to force parliament into a choice between backing her deal or leaving without an agreement.A majority of lawmakers agree with businesses, which say that outcome would be catastrophic for the world’s fifth largest economy: causing delays at ports, fracturing crucial international supply chains and hindering investment.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>

267,RBS Boosts Dividend But Warns Brexit Turmoil Could Hike Costs,"LONDON- Royal Bank of Scotland announced a better than expected dividend for investors including Britain’s government on Friday after its profit more than doubled in 2018, but warned Brexit turmoil would make it harder to achieve its cost-cutting goals.The majority state-owned lender said it would pay an annual dividend of 3.5 pence and a special dividend of 7.5 pence, taking the total payout, including an earlier interim dividend, to 13 pence per share.However RBS chief executive Ross McEwan warned the bank faced a difficult economic environment amid a “heightened level of uncertainty related to ongoing Brexit negotiations”.The bank said the political turmoil means it will struggle to hit its target of slashing its cost-to-income ratio to less than 50 percent as planned by 2020.RBS also warned more than 50 billion euros of cross-border payments had been put at risk by a potential chaotic departure from the European Union.The warnings on Brexit pulled down RBS shares by 0.5 percent in early trading.RBS reported a net profit of 1.6 billion pounds ($2.05 billion), above expectations of 1.4 billion pounds, according to a company-provided average of analyst forecasts and up from the prior year’s 752 million pounds.PAINFUL DECADEThe landmark dividend payout follows a painful decade of massive misconduct and restructuring costs for the bank following its 45 billion pound state rescue in 2008.Investors will be hopeful returns will rise further in the coming years, with the bank’s core capital ratio – a key measure of a lender’s resilience – coming in at 16.2 percent, giving it room to manoeuvre.However, RBS bosses have previously cautioned that concerns over Brexit’s potential impact on Britain’s economy could temper ambitions to rapidly boost payouts.The bank warned economic challenges could mean a spike in bad loans, including from major business failures.Despite the note of caution, impairments on bad loans fell 19 percent to 398 million pounds in 2018 and the bank did not make any further provision for Brexit preparations on top of the 100 million pound charge billed in the third quarter.RBS’s second consecutive year in the black will likely intensify speculation the Treasury will act swiftly to sell more of its stock.The lender remains 62 percent owned by British taxpayers, although the Conservative government has conducted two share sales as it looks to return it to private ownership.The bank’s net interest margin – a closely-watched measure of underlying lender profitability – increased two basis points to 1.95 percent quarter on quarter, which analysts at Goodbody said would “settle some nerves” amid investor concerns about profitability pressures on banks.McEwan’s total pay package for the year increased slightly to 3.6 million pounds, up from 3.5 million the previous year.The lender’s gender pay gap decreased slightly to 36.6 percent, down from 37.2 percent the previous year.The bank said income at its investment banking business Natwest Markets fell 24 percent in 2018, due to challenging market conditions for its fixed income, currencies and commodities unit in the fourth quarter."
268,"BSNL, Air India Account For Half Of Losses By PSUs","Amid talks of a suspected closure of BSNL, a startling data series by the Centre has revealed that the telecom major, along with aviation behemoth Air India, accounted for more than half of the total losses incurred by PSU firms year after year since 2011.In 2017-18, BSNL and Air India together accounted for 52% of Rs 25,181 crore losses incurred by the 52 loss-making PSUs in the country.India currently has around 300 PSUs of which 52 have been making losses for over a decade. Air India and BSNL have been the biggest contributors every year, showed the data available with the Centre. However, the needle has not moved much on the perpetual loss-makers except for a proposed discussion by the board of BSNL over options of divestment and closure next week, and one or more failed attempts by the Centre to sell its shares in Air India.The Air India sale, however, has been shelved and is expected to be back on the drawing board only after the new government is installed at the Centre.“The earliest I can see the expression of interest in Air India is June next,” disinvestment secretary Atanu Chakraborty told DH in an interview.BSNL made a cumulative loss of close to Rs 50,000 crore between 2011 and 2018, with Air India following at Rs 39,755 crore. The losses of Air India kept piling even after a Rs 30,000-crore lifeline to the state-owned carrier during 2012-2018, the data showed.Now, the government is planning to sell 100% of its stake in the Air India ground handling arm to service debt.On an average, losses of Air India remained in the range of Rs 5,500-Rs 6,000 crore each year since 2012-13, barring 2015-16 when they came below Rs 4,000 crore.In the case of BSNL, the losses jumped 60% to Rs 7,993 crore in 2017-18 from the previous year. BSNL had incurred a loss of Rs 4,793 crore in 2016-17."

U.S. duties on $200 billion worth of imports from China are scheduled to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if no deal is reached by March 1 to address U.S. demands that China curb forced technology transfers and better enforce intellectual property rights.Although U.S. President Donald Trump said earlier in the week that an extension of the deadline was possible if a “real deal” was close, Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said the White House had made no such decision.Several sources informed about the meetings told Reuters there was little indication negotiators had made major progress on sticking points to pave the way for a potential meeting between Xi and Trump in coming weeks to hammer out a deal.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
“Stalemate on the important stuff,” said one of the sources, all of whom requested anonymity because the talks are confidential.“There’s still a lot of distance between parties on structural and enforcement issues. I wouldn’t quite call it hitting a wall, but it’s not a field of dreams either,” said a second source.The Financial Times cited sources as saying the two sides were trying to reach a memorandum of understanding to help bring about a leaders meeting.A third source told Reuters the White House was “irate” over earlier reports that the Trump administration was considering a 60-day extension to the tariff deadline.Lighthizer and Mnuchin left their Beijing hotel on Friday afternoon without taking questions from reporters.‘SLEIGHT OF HAND’Reuters reported earlier that in recent meetings China has pledged to make its industrial subsidy programs compliant with World Trade Organization rules and end those that distort markets, but had offered no details on how it intends to achieve that goal.The offer has been met with scepticism from U.S. negotiators, in part because China has long refused to disclose its subsidies.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
And some in U.S. industry have been unimpressed with the extent of other reported Chinese offers to address U.S. concerns, such as Beijing’s proposal to increase purchases of U.S. semiconductors to $200 billion over six years.John Neuffer, President and CEO of the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), told Reuters that the offer would be “akin to an accounting sleight of hand” and “an attempt to rearrange our supply chains and drive them deeper into China”.“We are confident U.S. government negotiators will wisely dismiss this offer and continue pushing for meaningful reforms that create a fair and level playing field for U.S. companies doing business in China,” Neuffer said.The proposal, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, was part of a “recycled” package of goods purchase offers that Beijing first presented in the spring of 2018, a source told Reuters on Thursday.Many U.S. lawmakers and business groups have urged Trump in recent weeks not to settle for an agreement based largely on increased Chinese purchases of farm and energy commodities.Trump has said he did not expect to meet with Xi before March 1, but White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders has raised the possibility of a meeting between the leaders at the president’s Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
China has long denied Washington’s accusations of trade abuses, and it has retaliated to U.S. tariffs with its own duties on American goods.Some trade experts say China appears focused on securing a Xi-Trump meeting, in the hope that it would make a near-term deal to limit or reduce tariffs more likely."
270,Trump To Declare ‘Emergency’ To Fund Border Wall: Top Republican,"President Donald Trump will sign Congress’ border security compromise, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday, 14 February. The announcement removed the last ounce of suspense over the fate of a bill that would provide just a sliver of the money Trump wants to build a wall with Mexico but also would avoid a new government shutdown.But McConnell also said Trump would quickly declare a national emergency. The US president has said that move would give him power to divert money from other budget projects into wall building.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_2_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_2_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_2"" name=""aswift_2"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=1181757713&amp;adf=2873560910&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.3~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615634373&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Ftrump-to-declare-emergency-to-fund-border-wall-top-republican%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615634373326&amp;bpp=2&amp;bdt=1233&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D838fd8914bd02bdb-2229f61fe0c6008b%3AT%3D1615634372%3ART%3D1615634372%3AS%3DALNI_MY--JrV6ymw06wCVVEpYg3zIc8w_Q&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1034x280&amp;nras=3&amp;correlator=3140460558101&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=168631883.1615634369&amp;ga_sid=1615634372&amp;ga_hid=1204266475&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=3&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1373&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=44735931%2C21066433%2C44737458%2C21069710&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=1337521621219634&amp;pem=434&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=3&amp;uci=a!3&amp;btvi=1&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=BAbV5RVC8b&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=20"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!3"" data-google-query-id=""CM-2nYiTre8CFThEFQgdqkAG7A"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
McConnell also said he would support Trump’s emergency declaration. That was a turnabout for the Kentucky Republican, who like Democrats and many Republicans has until now opposed such a declaration.The emergency declaration will inject the likelihood of fresh conflict between Congress and Trump over his efforts to build barriers along the boundary with Mexico. Opponents have said there is no crisis at the border and Trump is merely sidestepping Congress.Dueling Plans to End US Shutdown Fail in Senate, Talks Resume‘Let’s Pray the Prez Has Wisdom’The Republican-controlled Senate began voting on the agreement Wednesday, and passage by that chamber and the Democratic-led controlled seemed certain.Trump had signaled he would sign the bill but it was unclear until McConnell’s announcement if he would do so, prompting some lawmakers to voice concern.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=1181757713&amp;adf=3106469320&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.13~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615634373&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Ftrump-to-declare-emergency-to-fund-border-wall-top-republican%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615634373326&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=1233&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D838fd8914bd02bdb-2229f61fe0c6008b%3AT%3D1615634372%3ART%3D1615634372%3AS%3DALNI_MY--JrV6ymw06wCVVEpYg3zIc8w_Q&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1034x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=3140460558101&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=168631883.1615634369&amp;ga_sid=1615634372&amp;ga_hid=1204266475&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=3&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2074&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=44735931%2C21066433%2C44737458%2C21069710&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=1337521621219634&amp;pem=434&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=6uGiQCFfLE&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=25"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""COOonoiTre8CFbdjFQgd8AsKFg"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
“Let’s all pray that the president will have wisdom to sign the bill so the government doesn’t shut down,” said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chiming in after a guest chaplain opened Thursday’s session.Trump’s assent would end a raucous legislative saga that commenced before Christmas and was ending, almost fittingly, on Valentine’s Day. The low point was the historically long 35-day partial federal shutdown, which Trump sparked and was in full force when Democrats took control of the House, compelling him to share power for the first time.Trump yielded on the shutdown 25 January after public opinion turned against him and congressional Republicans.He’d won not a nickel of the $5.7 billion he’d demanded for his wall but had caused missed paychecks for legions of federal workers and contractors and lost government services for countless others. It was a political fiasco for Trump and an early triumph for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi."

272,Let’S Switch To A New Style Of Presenting Budgets,"The Budget speech didn’t convey any sense of the trade-offs and the alternatives considered.Imagine a different way of presenting a Budget to India’s Parliament. The finance minister arrives at the Parliament complex with both hands free, not carrying any briefcase. He walks into the Parliament hall where a multimedia setup awaits him. With the permission of the Speaker, he stands to present the Budget, pulls out a pen drive from his pocket, loads it on the system and begins to give a slideshow presentation rather than reading out a speech from a printed text.He not only presents his government’s plan for the next fiscal year but also places the plan in a larger context of the past, present and future. Further, he clearly shows how the next year’s plan fits into the medium-term action plan as well as the longer-term vision of his government. Whenever he announces any new programme, he also gives a peep into how the programme is likely to evolve over time and address the problem it is designed for. His presentation is rich in infographics, bubble charts, and animation using data analytics to bring out sectoral inter-linkages of new programmes and provide the future outlook. All this is done so simply that it is understood by all parliamentarians. His slideshow lasts for half a day, if not longer, with a couple of short bio-breaks.The audience inside the hall listens to the presentation with rapt attention, absorbing the finer details, often taking notes without creating any disruption or ruckus. However, the Opposition members do raise their voice in unison to signal their approval or disapproval to any new reform or programme that is announced.All this may sound like utopia and a complete break from convention. But this is something that we urgently need to adopt if we are to raise the bar in making Budget discussions more meaningful, transparent and sophisticated. The starting point for this is to change the way in which the Budget is presented. The practice now of Budget presentations is quite basic, lacks details to convey a fuller picture, and raises a lot of questions for the want of more information. Little wonder then that the current practice invites rudimentary responses from the Opposition members.To illustrate how crude is the current practice of Budget presentation, here are a couple of examples from the recent Budget laid before the Lok Sabha on February 1. Providing direct income support to small and marginal farmers is one of the big announcements in the recent Budget. Given the problem of farm distress in India, the idea of direct income support to farmers has some merit and has been in discussion for some time now. So, no surprises here. The programme offers income support in the next fiscal year (FY 2019-20) of Rs 6,000 per farmer with a landholding of two hectares or less. The estimated funding liability of the government in the next fiscal year is Rs 75,000 crores and this will benefit around 12 crore small and marginal farmers.Without getting into the pros and cons of this exercise, the Budget doesn’t offer any sense of the alternatives considered – not necessarily alternatives to direct income support but alternatives to these cut-off limits. For example, it would have been good to know if the government had considered, say, the cut-off of three hectares’ landholding which would have benefited, say, 14 crore small farmers, but would have allowed income support of, say, only Rs 4,000 per farmer. But the government settled for the 2-hectare cut-off as the income of Rs 6,000 per farmer is the minimal support needed to make the scheme worthwhile for a poor farmer within the programme allocations of Rs 75,000 crores.The Budget speech didn’t convey any sense of the trade-offs and the alternatives considered. The Budget could have given some perspective on why those choices were made. In this hi-tech age, there are technological tools that could have been used to convey a much richer story.Similar is the case with the other big welfare programme, that is, the mega pension scheme for unorganised sector workers with monthly incomes up to Rs 15,000. The scheme is to provide an assured monthly pension of Rs 3,000 from the age of 60 years on the monthly contribution of a small affordable amount during the working age of such workers The Budget speech doesn’t contain any justification for these cut-offs and provides no sense of trade-offs. By providing information on the alternatives considered – at least on the next (second) best alternative – the quality of discussion gets raised to a higher level.A little more information to give a perspective on the decisions and choices can enhance the sophistication of the Budget discussion that follows. After all, the Budget’s intention is not to obfuscate issues or present a convoluted picture but to be transparent and informative to educate the audience. But this is not all.The other issue is that we don’t have standard indicators to capture the political dimensions of a Budget. Again, giving an example from the recent February 1 exercise, some degree of populism was anticipated in this pre-election Budget. However, there is no standard metric to capture the extent of populism contained to learn if a Budget is egregiously populist or if there is a healthy dose of populism. The extent of populism is of course situational. Still, it is possible to develop a few good indicators based on factors like wooing voters, countering perceived aggressiveness of the Opposition parties, optimising available public funding, striking a balance between equity, efficiency and growth, and so on. Perhaps it’s time that our political scientists develop “missing” indicators to better understand the political dimensions of a Budget.In keeping with the changing times, we need to change the practice of presenting Budgets in Parliament. The current practice lacks sophistication and invites rudimentary responses from the Opposition. Providing a richer account of a plan for the next fiscal year using tech tools and developing “missing” political indicators can be the way forward. This shouldn’t be difficult when Digital India is getting a big push in the country."
273,CAG’S Rafale Report Raises Many Questions,"The basis for the calculation is not presented as the CAG has excised the price data.The report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG) on the purchase of Rafale fighter jets from France – which has become a matter of deep controversy – doesn’t provide satisfaction on points of discord. There can be little doubt that the CAG will need to expand its present effort to be more comprehensive if its work is to carry conviction. This should ideally happen before the next Parliament has a chance to debate its report. The report, presented to Parliament on Wednesday, fails to shed light on some key questions, first raised by Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who made serious allegations that were amplified by carefully documented and well-sourced reports in the media along with defence ministry documents.The CAG report makes two principal assertions. The first is that the price contracted by the present government to buy 36 Rafale jets is 2.86 per cent cheaper than that negotiated to buy 136 of the same aircraft by the UPA government earlier. The basis for the calculation is not presented as the CAG has excised the price data. However, a media report by a credible defence analyst relying on sources involved in the negotiations suggests the price offered by Dassault Aviation in 2016 for 36 aircraft was 40 per cent higher than its offer in 2012 for 126 aircraft. The package cost was 19.5 billion euros in 2012, and this included the cost of aircraft, technology transfer (to HAL, the then Indian partner), India-specific enhancements, weapons systems on board, spares and maintenance guarantees. This works out to Rs 1,000 crores per aircraft. In contrast, the 2016 price was Rs 1,600 crores per aircraft.The second key point made by the CAG is that the delivery schedule offered in 2016 was five months quicker than the one proposed in 2012. For scrapping the UPA-era negotiations and signing a fresh contract by jettisoning HAL and introducing a practically-bankrupt Indian businessman into the proceedings, the Narendra Modi government cited the reasons of better price and faster delivery (to bolster security needs). But the CAG itself casts doubts on the government’s claimed five-month time advantage. It also criticises the government for not going for a fixed price formula, a point also made in a strong dissent note by the three “domain experts” in the Indian negotiating team, and accepting the French formula of price escalation instead. To be comprehensive, the CAG should have referenced the dissent note, which carries multi-dimensional insights. The CAG report will also be found wanting for not alluding to the gross violation of Defence Purchase Procedure 2013 and 2016, which resulted in the PMO conducting “parallel negotiations”, undercutting the official Indian negotiators, a point made by the then defence secretary in a note to then defence minister Manohar Parrkiar, allowing scope for possible legal action."

275,More Brexit Humiliation For Theresa May As Parliament Defeats Her Again,"LONDON: British lawmakers defeated Prime Minister Theresa May in a symbolic vote over her Brexit strategy on Thursday, undermining her pledge to European Union leaders that she can get the unpopular divorce deal approved if they grant her concessions.Lawmakers defeated the government 303-258 on the main motion asking them to reaffirm support for her plan to seek changes.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_2_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_2_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_2"" name=""aswift_2"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=2160780782&amp;adf=367613298&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.3~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615634414&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fmore-brexit-humiliation-for-theresa-may-as-parliament-defeats-her-again%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615634414444&amp;bpp=2&amp;bdt=934&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D838fd8914bd02bdb-2229f61fe0c6008b%3AT%3D1615634372%3ART%3D1615634372%3AS%3DALNI_MY--JrV6ymw06wCVVEpYg3zIc8w_Q&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280&amp;nras=3&amp;correlator=4840818727036&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=168631883.1615634369&amp;ga_sid=1615634414&amp;ga_hid=2112634285&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=8&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1317&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=21066433%2C31060139&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=2558504162506081&amp;pem=434&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=3&amp;uci=a!3&amp;btvi=1&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=Ss9wJ3bmQK&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=21"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!3"" data-google-query-id=""CK2Q5JuTre8CFRKKpwodSPQKiA"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
While the vote does not force the government to change tack, the numbers will undermine EU leaders` confidence that May can win parliament`s support for a revised agreement.The latest twist in the two-year negotiation to leave the EU underlines the deep divisions in parliament over how, or even whether, Britain should leave the bloc in its biggest political and trade policy shift in more than 40 years.It also increases the possibility of Britain leaving without a deal, a nightmare scenario for many businesses, but also of Brexit being delayed or potentially never happening at all.Up until the last minute before the votes, ministers and May`s chief whip, her enforcer in the House of Commons, tried to convince a group of Brexit supporters favouring a radical break with the EU that leaving without an agreement was still the legal default position.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=2160780782&amp;adf=120153306&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.9~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615634414&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fmore-brexit-humiliation-for-theresa-may-as-parliament-defeats-her-again%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615634414444&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=934&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D838fd8914bd02bdb-2229f61fe0c6008b%3AT%3D1615634372%3ART%3D1615634372%3AS%3DALNI_MY--JrV6ymw06wCVVEpYg3zIc8w_Q&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=4840818727036&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=168631883.1615634369&amp;ga_sid=1615634414&amp;ga_hid=2112634285&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=8&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1928&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=21066433%2C31060139&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=2558504162506081&amp;pem=434&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=AE9b9SxlJp&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=28"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CM6h5JuTre8CFQbyYgodhnEMng"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>

Some Conservative and many opposition lawmakers accuse May of “running down the clock”, edging Britain closer to the exit date to try to force parliament into a choice between backing her deal or leaving without an agreement.To try to prevent a no-deal exit, several lawmakers put down alternative proposals.The real crunch date for the government looks set to come on Feb. 27, when May has promised the next round of votes. Lawmakers seeking to force the government to delay Brexit say that will be moment they make their move."
276,"India Slams Pakistan After Pulwama Attack, Islamabad Rejects Link","India on Thursday, 15 February, slammed Pakistan over the Pulwama terror attack, carried out allegedly by Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), and asked the country to stop supporting terrorists and dismantle terror infrastructure operating from its soil.India strongly reiterated its appeal to all members of the international community, to support the proposal to list terrorists, including JeM Chief Masood Azhar, as a designated terrorist under the 1267 Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council. It also called for a ban on terrorist organisations operating from territories controlled by Pakistan.

Priyanka, Salman, KJo Mourn Loss of Jawans in Pulwama AttackMEA Calls Pulwama Attack ‘Heinous, Despicable’“The Indian government condemns in the strongest possible terms, the cowardly terrorist attack on India’s brave security forces in Pulwama,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.“This heinous and despicable act has been perpetrated by Jaish-e-Mohammed, a Pakistan-based terrorist organisation proscribed by the United Nations and other countries,” it said.‘Azhar Given Full Freedom By Pak’Further condemning the incident, the MEA said, this terror group is led by international terrorist Masood Azhar, who has been given full freedom by the Pakistani government to operate and expand his terror infrastructure in territories under Pakistan’s control and to carry out attacks in India and elsewhere with impunity.The Indian government is firmly and resolutely committed to take all necessary measures to safeguard national security, it added.Ministry of External Affairs Statement”We are equally resolved to fight against the menace of terrorism. We demand that Pakistan stop supporting terrorists and terror groups operating from their territory, and dismantle the infrastructure operated by terrorist outfits to launch attacks in other countries.”“We express our sincere condolences to the family members of our fearless security personnel who have made the supreme sacrifice,” the MEA said.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 200px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:200px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:200px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
‘India Stands United’: Politicians Decry Attack in J&amp;K’s Pulwama"
277,"No Security Breach Of Aadhaar Database, Existing Security Controls Are Robust, Says UIDAI","The Unique Identification Authority of India told the Delhi High Court on Thursday that there was no security breach of its database or the Central Identity Data Repository and asked the court to dismiss a plea seeking damages for Aadhaar data “leaks”, PTI reported.In an affidavit filed before a bench of Justices Ravindra Bhat and Prateek Jalan, the UIDAI reiterated that its existing security controls and protocols are “robust and capable of countering any such attempts or malicious designs of data breach or hacking”.The affidavit by UIDAI was filed in response to a petition by Kerala-based lawyer Shamnad Basheer who claimed that the personal information of individuals had been leaked due to several breaches in the Aadhaar system since January 2018. He also alleged that both the UIDAI and the central government were liable to compensate people whose data had been compromised.Earlier, the High Court had directed the Centre and the UIDAI to respond to the petition in the wake of several reported leaks of personal data from the Aadhaar database. The petition noted that in one such alleged breach, a media house had managed to gain access to the entire database by paying a sum of Rs 500. The breach was later acknowledged by UIDAI and had led to the lodging of a criminal case against those involved, said the petition.The petition added that the leaks occurred due to the “negligence and willful recklessness” on part of the UIDAI to adopt reasonable security measures to secure private data.However, the UIDAI in its affidavit stated that security of Aadhaar was of “critical importance and is given paramount significance”. It added that the UIDAI constantly works to strengthen and review its infrastructure in line with the best international security practices and technological standards. The Aadhaar authority also gives utmost importance to multi-layered security and privacy considerations, it said.The UIDAI observed that the petition was no longer maintainable after the Supreme Court last year upheld most provisions of the Aadhaar Act. “The writ petition is not maintainable after the Supreme Court’s judgment in K Puttaswamy vs Union of India, by which the Aadhaar Act and scheme were upheld for the most part,” it said. “The issues raised in the petition are squarely covered by the judgement.”The UIDAI denied the allegations of any data breach as “false and baseless” and said the petitioner has been unable to demonstrate how his rights have been affected.The State Bank of India last month had alleged that the login and biometric details of several Aadhaar operators, who were penalised last year, were misused to generate unauthorised Aadhaar cards.The petition also urged the High Court to direct the Centre to either allow people to opt out of the system or delete their existing UIDAI data. UIDAI Chief Executive Officer Ajay Bhushan Pandey on Thursday said the government will seek legal counsel on whether it can delete the biometric data of minors who choose to exit the Aadhaar system once they turn 18."

280,"Rebuking Trump, US House Agrees To Withdraw Troops In Yemen","Asserting congressional authority over war-making powers, the House passed a resolution on Wednesday, 13 February, that would force the administration to withdraw US troops from involvement in Yemen, in a rebuke of President Donald Trump’s alliance with the Saudi-led coalition behind the military intervention.Lawmakers in both parties are increasingly uneasy over the humanitarian crisis in Yemen and skeptical of the US partnership with that coalition, especially in light of Saudi Arabia’s role in the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the royal family.Passage would mark the first time Congress has relied on the decades-old War Powers Resolution to halt military intervention. It also would set up a potential confrontation with the White House, which has threatened a veto. The House voted 248-177 to approve the measure, sending it to the Senate, where a similar resolution passed last year.UN envoy in Yemen amid preparation for peace talks“We have helped create, and worsen, the world’s largest humanitarian crisis,” said Barbara Lee, Representative for California’s, during the debate. “Our involvement in this war, quite frankly, is shameful.”The chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, Eliot Engel, Representative for New York , said the vote represents “Congress reclaiming its role in foreign policy.”Senate approval would set up a showdown with the administration – a veto would be Trump’s first – over the president’s shifting approach on foreign policy.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_2_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_2_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 280px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: visible;""><iframe id=""aswift_2"" name=""aswift_2"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=648100100&amp;adf=2963766096&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.9~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615634467&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Frebuking-trump-us-house-agrees-to-withdraw-troops-in-yemen%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615634467546&amp;bpp=2&amp;bdt=1122&amp;idt=2&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D139b1cbc2fce8518-222bf977ddc6002f%3AT%3D1615634463%3ART%3D1615634463%3AS%3DALNI_MZqb0x9uxsctq1cf2FE7UHHK7MU0g&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1034x280&amp;nras=3&amp;correlator=5480487705538&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1632864098.1615634461&amp;ga_sid=1615634467&amp;ga_hid=1251578783&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=3&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1773&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=44737537&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=625870106332055&amp;pem=355&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=3&amp;uci=a!3&amp;btvi=1&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=ysCOaatSUO&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=30"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!3"" data-google-query-id=""COmejbWTre8CFX4trQYdudUGFQ"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
Lawmakers are quick to point out that Trump wants to withdraw troops from the wars in Syria and Afghanistan as part of his “America First” approach, but he has shown less interest in limiting the US role in Yemen.White House Calls Resolution Flawed, Claims Troops not Directly Involved in YemenThe White House says the House resolution is “flawed” because US troops are not directly involved in military action in Yemen, where the coalition is fighting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in a conflict largely seen as a proxy war involving the Mideast’s dominant regional players.Since 2015, the administration says, the US has provided support to the coalition, including intelligence and, until recently, aerial refueling, but it has not had forces involved in “hostilities.”<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
Congress has not invoked the War Power Resolution, which requires approval of military actions, since it was enacted in 1973. Lawmakers approved more sweeping authorisations for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that some argue are being used too broadly for other military actions.Senate votes to end US military support for Saudis in YemenNewly emboldened Democrats in the House, eager to confront Trump on foreign policy, and Republicans in both chambers have shown a willingness to put a legislative check on the president’s agenda.In the House, 18 Republicans, including members of the GOP’s libertarian-leaning wing and Trump allies in the conservative Freedom Caucus, joined Democrats in passing the Yemen measure.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
Ro Khanna, Representative from California’s , who drafted the legislation, said there’s an emerging bipartisan alliance that’s skeptical of military intervention without congressional oversight.Ro Khanna, Representative from California”It’s not just about Yemen. It’s about the Congress taking a stand and every future president having to think twice about whether to authorise a military intervention without congressional approval.”The Senate version is from independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and backed by Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee.Before Wednesday’s vote, the House overwhelmingly agreed to add an amendment offered by Republicans who are seeking to expose emerging Democratic divisions over support for Israel.The amendment reaffirms the US commitment “to combat anti-Semitism around the world” and says it’s in the national security interest to oppose boycotts of Israel. That’s a reference to the Boycott, Divest and Sanction movement that has gained support of some lawmakers.First-term Rep Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, one of the Muslim-American women elected to Congress, came under criticism this week for her comments against the Israel lobbying organisation AIPAC that raised anti-Semitic stereotypes. She later apologised.US Senate Votes to End Support for Saudi-Led Yemen War, Blasts MBS<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 250px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:250px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:250px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
The House added another GOP amendment that would allow continued intelligence sharing, which drew fire from the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU warned it gives the president broad authority to provide the Saudis and others with US intelligence information about Yemen, and the group said the package, overall, is now weaker than originally proposed.Now the Yemen measure goes to the Senate, where a similar resolution on removing US involvement in the war was approved with Republican support late last year.At the time, Congress was eager to send a message to both the president and the Saudis after the October murder of the US-based journalist Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.The US has sanctioned 17 Saudi individuals for their involvement in the killing, and US intelligence officials have concluded that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, must have at least known of the plot. Trump so far has decided not to impose harsher penalties on the prince. The kingdom insists he did not order the killing.The outcome of the legislation is uncertain. Republicans control the Senate, 53-47, and a simple majority is needed to pass.Trump has yet to veto any measures from Congress. If he did veto the Yemen resolution, it’s unclear whether lawmakers would have enough support to override him."

282,Nationals Will Help In Preparation For All England: Praneeth,"Guwahati: A crammed BWF calendar affecting his fitness last season, Indian shuttler B Sai Praneeth says he will pick his tournaments carefully in the Olympic qualification year and is eyeing a national title to prepare for the All England Championship next month.With defending champion HS Prannoy and finalist Kidambi Srikanth withdrawing due to fitness issues, former champion Praneeth will be one of the favourites to lift the trophy at the 83rd Senior Nationals, which got underway with the qualifiers here on Tuesday.“Last season, I struggled with my fitness and confidence because there were too many tournaments. So I couldn’t maintain fitness. From June to December, I played continuously, so it was all about fitness. I am fine now and fortunately no injuries,” Praneeth told PTI.“I am looking forward to All England next month and Nationals will be good match practice to prepare. It will help my confidence ahead of the international events. You have to beat all the top Indian players to win it and it is not easy because everyone is playing well,” said Praneeth, who will also play the Swiss Open this year.The Olympic qualification period will be between April 29, 2019 to April 26, 2020, and the BWF rankings published on April 30, 2020 will decide who makes the cut for the Tokyo Games.Praneeth, who is currently ranked 26th, said he will need a bit of luck and series a consistent performances to earn him a ticket to the Olympics.“It is an Olympic qualification year, so scheduling of the tournaments will be important. I can afford not to play a few events. We will need a bit of luck and good performance. I have to play quarters and semis consistently, but that won’t be easy, so you also need a favourable draw sometimes.“Indonesia I got Chen Long in first round, so when the seeds lose early, it opens up the draw.”Badminton Association of India (BAI) has recently appointed two Korean coaches — Kim Ji Hyun and Park Tae Sang – to work with the players ahead of the Olympics.The 26-year-old from Hyderabad, who clinched the Singapore Open in 2017, said he is early waiting to work with the foreign coaches who will be joining the Indian badminton set-up next month.“They are experienced coaches, who have been associated with the national team last year. So it will help us because Indians have always been struggled with fitness, he said.“Even Mulyo (Handoyo) had mostly focused on fitness and it suited us, helped us to perform. Every foreign coach brings a different method, so lets see what they make us do. ”Under Mulyo, who was roped in by the Sports Authority of India in 2017, Indian shuttlers had a breakthrough year with Srikanth winning as many as four titles out of five finals and Praneeth winning his maiden Singapore Open Super Series title and PV Sindhu claiming two super series titles. The Indonesian coach left at the end of that season.Asked if Mulyo’s departure was one of the reasons behind Indians not winning a lot of titles, Praneeth said: “I know some people believe so, but he left at the right time and we would never know what would have been his contribution or our performance in his presence in such a hectic schedule.”Praneeth won six of the eight matches he played for the eventual champion, Bengaluru Raptors, in the fourth edition of Premier Badminton League (PBL) and he says it boosted his confidence ahead of the international season.“I had 90 per cent winning rate at the PBL, so it was awesome. It boosted my confidence. This time it was more satisfying as I won most matches and pulled off crucial ties for my team,” he signed off."
283,Japan’S Osaka In Shock Split With Tennis Coach Bajin,"Tokyo: World number one Naomi Osaka has split from her coach Sascha Bajin just weeks after winning the Australian Open to complete back-to-back grand slam victories, the Japanese player said Monday.“Hey everyone, I will no longer be working together with Sascha. I thank him for his work and wish him all the best in the future,” the 21-year-old tweeted in a shock announcement.Bajin, a former hitting partner to Serena Williams, responded: “Thank you Naomi. I wish you nothing but the best as well. What a ride that was. Thank you for letting me be part of this.”Osaka, who became the first Asian to hold the top ranking after beating Czech Petra Kvitova in the Melbourne final, had worked with the German for just over a year. No reason was given for the decision to part ways.The Japanese player captured her first slam by stunning Williams at last year’s US Open in a final remembered as much for the American’s astonishing rant at the chair umpire following a coaching violation.Based in the United States, Osaka linked up with Bajin in late 2017 and enjoyed a breakthrough year, climbing from 72 in the world to the top of the women’s rankings.During that period she won the prestigious Indian Wells tournament before scooping her first major in New York, while Bajin was named WTA coach of the year.Osaka, who grew up in the US and speaks little Japanese, melted hearts when she fought back tears after her emotional US Open win over her idol Williams as booing echoed around the stadium.She won more fans with a nail-biting 7-6, 5-7, 6-4 win over Kvitova in the Australian Open final, after which Osaka sobbed tears of joy as the jeers were replaced by cheers.Former greats Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert have all heaped praise on the new darling of women’s tennis.“Winning back-to-back grand slam tournaments is a rare and special achievement, and I’m thrilled these results have propelled Naomi to the top of the women’s game,” said Chris Evert, the first ever WTA world number one.“Her exciting brand of tennis, coupled with the dignity she displays on and off court, is a winning combination that tennis fans really embrace.”"
284,Arsenal’S Aaron Ramsey Signs $4.1 Million Deal With Juventus,"Milan: Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey has signed a four-year deal to join Juventus on a free transfer from next July, the Italian champions said on Monday. The 28-year-old Wales international will arrive in northern Italy on July 1 with his contract running until June 30, 2023. As his contract will have ended, Arsenal will not be entitled to a transfer fee.“As a result of the registration of the player, Juventus will incur additional costs of 3.7 million euros ($4.1 million), to be paid by July 10,” the Serie A champions said.The move brings to an end Ramsey’s 11-year spell with the Gunners having moved from Cardiff City in 2008. Over the past decade, he has played 256 Premier League games, scoring 38 top-flight goals, and winning three FA Cup and two Community Shield. He also had two loan spells at Nottingham Forest in 2010, and back at former club, Cardiff in 2011.“I wanted to issue a personal statement for all the Arsenal fans who have been extremely loyal and supportive,” Ramsey wrote on Instagram.“You welcomed me as a teenager and have been there for me through all the highs and lows I have encountered during my time at the club.“It is with a heavy heart that I leave after 11 incredible years in north London. Thank you.“I will continue to give the team 100 per cent and hope to finish the season strongly, before heading on to my next chapter in Turin.” Ramsey has 58 caps for Wales, scoring 14 goals, and was a part of the Welsh side that reached the Euro 2016 semi-finals.He becomes the third Welshman to play for Juventus following club legend John Charles and former European Golden Boot winner Ian Rush. Ramsey had turned down the offer of a new deal at Arsenal, with clubs including Barcelona, Real Madrid, Paris Saint Germain, Inter Milan and Bayern Munich linked with the player.“Everyone at Arsenal Football Club wishes Aaron Ramsey a happy and successful future,” the London club said in a statement.“Aaron’s made a fantastic contribution to our club since joining from Cardiff City in 2008. He has always been a consummate professional and will always have a special place in the hearts and memories of Arsenal fans around the world.” Juventus have an 11-point lead on top of Serie A and are on track for an eighth consecutive league title.They are through to the Champions League knock-out rounds and will play Atletico Madrid in the last 16 starting next week. Ramsey will reportedly become Juventus’ second-highest earner behind Cristiano Ronaldo earning 7 million euros ($7.8 million) a season."
285,Roger Federer Rules Himself Out Of Monte Carlo Masters,"20-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer has ruled out participating in this year’s Monte Carlo Masters, which is slated to be held from April 13 to 21 in France.In recent years, the 37-year-old Swiss star has missed the clay-court seasons in its entirety, including the second major of the season–French Open, in order to boost up his preparation for his all-time favourite grass-court season.Federer, however, hinted that the schedule is likely to be changed this time around after he slumped to a shocking defeat at the hands of 20-year-old Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas in the fourth round of the men’s singles event at the season-opening Australian Open.Though the tennis great opened up on his possible clay-court return, it seems that Monte Carlo Masters is definitely not in his list.“I do not want to play much more. I’d rather train more and prepare well for the grass-court season, I do not definitely want to overdo it, “Sport24 quoted Federer as saying.“What tournament should we look at? Monte Carlo is probably too early,” he added.Federer is most likely to make a return on clay-court with either Madrid Open (May 3) or Italian Open (May 6)."
286,"Harbhajan Singh Picks His 15-Member Squad For World Cup, Which Includes","As the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) selectors and Indian team management are mulling over India’s squad for the upcoming ICC World Cup 2019, veteran off-spinner, Harbhajan Singh, has prepared a list of 15 players he would want to fly over to England.Harbhajan has picked Team India skipper Virat Kohli along with his deputy Rohit Sharma and opener Shikhar Dhawan. He has also picked Ambati Rayudu, Kedar Jadhav, along with former skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni for Team India’s World Cup squad.The CSK star has also included spin-all rounder Ravindra Jadeja in his squad along with spinner twins Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav. He also picked Umesh Yadav in his squad and backed all-rounder Vijay Shankar to come good if given a chance during the World Cup.In the just concluded three-match T20I series against New Zealand, Vijay Shanker was impressive with the bat, though he was not given the ball by Rohit Sharma as the stand-in skipper put his trust in Pandya brothers (Krunal and Hardik Pandya) to do the job.Other than Umesh Yadav, Harbhajan has picked Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, and Jasprit Bumrah in the pace department. Surprisingly, Bhaji ignored Rishabh Pant but included Dinesh Karthik.“If you remember, during the 2017 Champions Trophy, the weather in the UK was hot and humid. So, if conditions are same, Jadeja could still be used as a package, if the opposition team has five to six right-handers in their line-up. Play him as No.6 with Hardik Pandya as No.7. Also, he is still your best fielder,” Harbhajan Singh told PTI in an interview.Harbhajan Singh’s 15-man squad for the 2019 ICC World Cup: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni, Kedar Jadhav, Hardik Pandya, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Yuzvendra Chahal, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Dinesh Karthik, Umesh Yadav, and Vijay Shankar.

“Here is one of the safest cities in the United States of America, safe not because of walls but in spite of walls,” O`Rourke told a crowd of several thousand supporters, many waving “Beto 2020” signs and wearing “Immigrants Make America Great” baseball caps.Two hundred yards away in El Paso County Coliseum, Trump told his supporters that O`Rourke had “little going for himself.” “We are all challenged by a young man who lost an election to (Republican Senator) Ted Cruz,” said Trump, surrounded by banners reading “Finish the Wall.”Trump was in El Paso to argue for a wall he says can protect Americans from violent criminals, drugs and a “tremendous onslaught” of migrant caravans. The rally was his first direct clash with a potential 2020 rival, albeit on separate stages.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=245356309&amp;adf=4073470960&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.7~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615634527&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fex-democratic-congressman-beto-orourke-trump-trade-blows-in-rival-texas-border-rallies%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615634527505&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=1077&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D139b1cbc2fce8518-222bf977ddc6002f%3AT%3D1615634463%3ART%3D1615634463%3AS%3DALNI_MZqb0x9uxsctq1cf2FE7UHHK7MU0g&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1034x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=3132736309613&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1632864098.1615634461&amp;ga_sid=1615634527&amp;ga_hid=1678685544&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=10&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1982&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=31060352&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=1318595102572155&amp;pem=355&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=kdE0MLzozQ&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=17"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CIK129GTre8CFT0S-QAdRLgEUg"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
As Trump and O`Rourke spoke, US congressional negotiators in Washington said they had reached a tentative deal on border security funding to avert another partial government shutdown due to start on Saturday. An aide said it did not include the $5.7 billion Trump has demanded for his wall, however.“BUILD THE WALL”O’Rourke relished the prime-time national platform, sometimes breaking into Spanish as he decried the Trump administration’s separation of immigrant children from their parents at the border. He said Dreamers – undocumented people brought to the United States by their parents when they were children – should be given citizenship, and their parents a pathway to citizenship.“With a president who describes Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals, we have a chance to tell him and the country that immigrants commit crime at a lower rate that Americans who are born in this country,” he said to shouts of “Beto, Beto.”<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
Trump traveled to the Democratic bastion of El Paso county in the heavily-Republican Texas to hammer on immigration issues that delighted his followers. “I will never sign a bill that forces the mass release of violent criminals into our country,” Trump said, referring to a Democratic proposal in the Washington talks to lower the cap on detentions of criminal aliens by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).A congressional aide said under Monday`s tentative agreement, the cap would likely stay around the same in previous years. Trump said he had heard about progress in the talks before he took the stage, but did not mention details.“Just so you know – we`re building the wall anyway,” he said, to huge cheers. For much of his speech, Trump recounted accomplishments from his first term. He was also interrupted several times by protesters in the crowd who were escorted out by security.“BUILD THE WALL!” the crowd chanted as they were led out. Although O’Rourke`s full-throated denunciation of the president sounded like a campaign speech, the two-time congressman declined to discuss a potential run on Monday when asked by reporters on a conference call.O’Rourke told Oprah Winfrey last week he would make a final decision about running for president by the end of the month."

Senior congressional aides told AFP the agreement included $1.375 billion in funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border — a key campaign promise of President Donald Trump, who had demanded $5.7 billion for his pet project.The agreed figure would fund approximately 55 miles (89 kilometers), all to be located in the Rio Grande Valley area of south Texas, the aides said.The deal still faces White House approval.The Democrats and Trump have been clashing for weeks over funding a barrier on the border.The gridlock prompted the longest government shutdown in US history — lasting over a month — that ended January 25 when Trump signed into law a deal giving lawmakers three weeks to come up with an agreement, or face further paralysis.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=1414548025&amp;adf=1570077821&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.11~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615634535&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fus-parties-reach-tentative-deal-to-avoid-another-government-shutdown%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615634535684&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=931&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D139b1cbc2fce8518-222bf977ddc6002f%3AT%3D1615634463%3ART%3D1615634463%3AS%3DALNI_MZqb0x9uxsctq1cf2FE7UHHK7MU0g&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=6681250908444&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1632864098.1615634461&amp;ga_sid=1615634535&amp;ga_hid=195869863&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=11&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1971&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=44737536%2C31060287%2C31060031%2C31060428&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=4339911779928026&amp;pem=355&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=j4WtdY2qPm&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=32"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CPunzNWTre8CFWARrQYdSA8P0Q"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>

Thuringia is a world leader in the optics industry, while its automotive industry boasts of leading global majors such as Daimler, Opel, Magna, Bosch and BMW.“Since 2012, there has been a major improvement in our business relations with Thuringia’s exports to India jumping 34 per cent in 2018 over the previous year to touch 150 million euros,” Tiefensee said.The Minister said Thuringia offers excellent conditions in mechanical engineering for generating innovations and launching internationally successful products and technologies.Around 10,000 scientists are doing research in the state in more than 40 institutes and universities in close cooperation with businesses, he added.An MoU was signed on the occasion between Thuringian firm Gramme-Revit and Indian distributor WB for a new food supplement against arthritis called DuoVital.In his address earlier, Jasper Weick, Charge de Affairs at the Germany Embassy here, said that India and Germany have strong commonalities in their adoption of democracy, federalism and the free market.He said that the India-Germany bilateral trade had risen at a healthy 10 per cent last year to touch nearly $22 billion.Investments in both directions were thriving and close to 1,700 German companies were doing business with and out of India, he added."

However, the budget for a wall along the Mexico border is far less than what President Donald Trump had demanded, officials said.“We’ve reached an agreement in principle between us on the Homeland Security and the other six bills,” Republican Senator Richard Shelby told reporters.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_2_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_2_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_2"" name=""aswift_2"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=1320713571&amp;adf=3512091255&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.3~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615634569&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fus-congress-reaches-tentative-deal-on-border-wall-funding-to-avoid-another-government-shutdown%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615634569007&amp;bpp=2&amp;bdt=1305&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D1efe460dd856aedf-22d6951acbc60087%3AT%3D1615634565%3ART%3D1615634565%3AS%3DALNI_MY1T1wvpQNbAZpo4r5lbgrV9XCRhA&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280&amp;nras=3&amp;correlator=8736045712373&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1747469876.1615634561&amp;ga_sid=1615634568&amp;ga_hid=724565133&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=3&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1368&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=44737561%2C21066428%2C21069000%2C44738185&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=2367938471615871&amp;pem=286&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=3&amp;uci=a!3&amp;btvi=1&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=utOA5PDXDk&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=22"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!3"" data-google-query-id=""CLn_veWTre8CFZABrQYdSZ4AGA"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
The border wall was one of the Trump election campaign’s main promises. The disagreement over funding the wall on the border ended up in the longest government shutdown in December-January. It left more than 800,000 government workers without pay, until the shutdown ended when Trump signed a deal on January 25 to give the Congress 21 days to come up with an agreement or face further blocking of funds.The details of the new agreement will not be officially released until Tuesday, AP reported. Unidentified congressional aides told AP that the Republicans agreed to settle for a figure of $1.4 billion, instead of Trump’s demand of $5.7 billion. This would fund 55 miles of new fencing, constructed with existing materials such as metal slats, instead of a concrete wall. The fencing will be built in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=1320713571&amp;adf=4108031273&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.7~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615634569&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fus-congress-reaches-tentative-deal-on-border-wall-funding-to-avoid-another-government-shutdown%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615634569007&amp;bpp=2&amp;bdt=1306&amp;idt=2&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D1efe460dd856aedf-22d6951acbc60087%3AT%3D1615634565%3ART%3D1615634565%3AS%3DALNI_MY1T1wvpQNbAZpo4r5lbgrV9XCRhA&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=8736045712373&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1747469876.1615634561&amp;ga_sid=1615634568&amp;ga_hid=724565133&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=3&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1962&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=44737561%2C21066428%2C21069000%2C44738185&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=2367938471615871&amp;pem=286&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=WN9anjUUhz&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=30"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CIa9vuWTre8CFXInrQYdGX8AGQ"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
Trump was holding a rally in the border city of El Paso in Texas when the tentative deal was announced. “Just so you know – we are building the wall anyway,” he said at the rally, according to Reuters. “Maybe progress has been made – maybe not.”The agreement also included curbing funds for Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention beds. Democrats claimed the number of beds would be brought down to 40,520 as against the 49,000 beds on February 10, the most recent date when figures were available."

After initially denying his death, Saudi Arabia has confirmed that its agents killed Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of the Saudi government. Riyadh denies its senior leaders were behind the killing.US lawmakers, Democrats and some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, have sought a strong response by Washington to Khashoggi’s murder and to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels.The Trump administration had faced a February 8 deadline to send a report to Congress on who was responsible for Khashoggi’s death and whether the US government would impose sanctions on those behind the killing.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=2403705525&amp;adf=3561073025&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.9~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615634584&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fus-not-covering-up-journalist-khashoggis-murder-mike-pompeo%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615634584151&amp;bpp=3&amp;bdt=869&amp;idt=3&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D1efe460dd856aedf-22d6951acbc60087%3AT%3D1615634565%3ART%3D1615634565%3AS%3DALNI_MY1T1wvpQNbAZpo4r5lbgrV9XCRhA&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=7951217678791&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1747469876.1615634561&amp;ga_sid=1615634584&amp;ga_hid=1183791853&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=5&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1926&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=42530671%2C31060305%2C44737458&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=685060799019582&amp;pem=286&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=BePBLjVeyr&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=35"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CIf42uyTre8CFYEB-QAdPM4PcA"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
Ahead of the deadline, a group of Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday renewed their push to penalize Saudi Arabia, unveiling legislation to bar some arms sales and impose sanctions.President Donald Trump has resisted such legislative efforts, viewing weapons sales as an important source of US jobs and standing by Saudi crown prince and Trump’s ally, Mohammed bin Salman. Trump is also reluctant to disturb the strategic relationship with the kingdom, seen as an important regional counterbalance to Iran.Eleven suspects have been indicted in Saudi Arabia for Khashoggi’s murder, and on Friday a top Saudi official rejected accusations that the crown prince ordered the killing.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_4"" name=""aswift_4"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=2403705525&amp;adf=425937289&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.15~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615634584&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fus-not-covering-up-journalist-khashoggis-murder-mike-pompeo%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615634584158&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=875&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D1efe460dd856aedf-22d6951acbc60087%3AT%3D1615634565%3ART%3D1615634565%3AS%3DALNI_MY1T1wvpQNbAZpo4r5lbgrV9XCRhA&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1017x280%2C699x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=5&amp;correlator=7951217678791&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1747469876.1615634561&amp;ga_sid=1615634584&amp;ga_hid=1183791853&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=5&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2229&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=42530671%2C31060305%2C44737458&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=685060799019582&amp;pem=286&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=5&amp;uci=a!5&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=9D087ktf0G&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=506"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!5"" data-google-query-id=""CMib-OyTre8CFeoS-QAdnecM_A"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
On Friday, a State Department representative said Pompeo had briefed US lawmakers on the murder investigation but gave no other details.Democratic US Senator Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees, on Sunday said the required report was not submitted and accused the Trump administration of complicity in covering up the killing.“This amounts to the Trump administration aiding in the cover-up of a murder,” Kaine said in a statement. “America should never descend to this level of moral bankruptcy.”"
293,Rupee Gains 6 Paise Against Dollar In Opening Trade,"The rupee strengthened by 6 paise at 71.12 against the dollar in opening trade Tuesday, maintaining its upward trend for the sixth straight day on continued selling of the US currency by exporters and banks.Besides, optimism ahead of index of industrial production (IIP) numbers for December and retail inflation for January, and the dollar weakening against some other currencies overseas, also supported the rupee, forex dealers said.A positive opening in the domestic equity market gave the uptrend some momentum, they added.The rupee opened lower at 71.21, but recovered to trade 6 paise higher at 71.12 against the dollar.The benchmark BSE Sensex rose 22.20 points, or 0.06 per cent, to 36,417.23 in early session Tuesday.On Monday, the rupee had ended higher by 13 paise to close at 71.18 against the dollar on easing crude oil prices, even as the greenback strengthened vis-a-vis other major currencies."
294,Arun Jaitley Is Not Just A ‘Blogger’- He’S BJP’S True Spinmeister,"Lawyer-politician Arun Jaitley, till recently India’s finance minister (now a minister without portfolio following a health scare), has often derisively been called a Blog Minister.The title is due to Jaitley’s frequent online blogs in defence of his party and government and is meant to suggest that Jaitley and his erstwhile portfolio were unimportant in a dispensation pre-occupied with headline-hunting, political conspiracies and communal polarisation. How else does a senior minister, handling what is widely considered the second most important job in the land, find the time to regularly pen his thoughts on subjects not always within his purview?Why Arun Jaitley is Grumbling About ‘Tyranny of the Un-Elected’Arun Jaitley, The Prolific BloggerIt is true that Jaitley’s stint as finance minister – marked by lows in job creation and investment, and serious credibility issues with economic data – has been far from distinguished, but his importance in the current power set-up may lie elsewhere.To his detractors, Jaitley’s blogging may be a non-serious pursuit taking away attention from his onerous responsibilities, but its utility to the BJP is difficult to overlook.Jaitley’s writings, thanks to his legal training and experience, have sophisticated spin and legal argumentation that have given a certain kind of BJP sympathiser – those with pretensions to reason and refinement – the ammunition to counter the Modi sarkaar’s critics. Not everyone may read Jaitley’s blogs first hand, but the blog content informs enough memes for the message to travel.Whether it is the government’s handling of relations with the country’s central bank or premier investigative agency, underscoring the problems with coalition governments or deflecting the Opposition’s barbs on the Rafale deal, Jaitley’s blogs have tried shoring up the BJP’s shaky positions with reasonable-sounding logic and catchy hook phrases. It is a different matter that holes remain in Jaitley’s positions.‘Kleptocrat’s Club’: Jaitley Slams Mamata, Didi Says Recover FirstThe Technical-Intellectual Facade Jaitley’s Blogs Offer BJPSo, Jaitley evocatively writes of the ‘tyranny of the unelected’ when dwelling on his government’s testy relations with the Reserve Bank of India and the Central Bureau of Investigation, but skirts the crucial point about how and why constitutional powers are by design allocated between the elected and the un-elected.Arun Jaitley speaks of the decisive, forward-thinking government only a majority government can offer, without once reflecting on the irony of being in a coalition government himself, or his party’s ongoing attempts to woo new, and retain old allies.Critics of Jaitley’s party and government are dubbed ‘compulsive contrarians’, and the terms of the Rafale debate are cleverly changed as Jaitley waxes eloquent on the deal – its implications for India’s defence preparedness, the fine points of the agreement the Opposition has apparently missed, the Supreme Court’s ‘clean chit’ on procedural and commercial aspects, etc – without responding to the Opposition’s specific questions on price change, the Defence Ministry’s objections to the negotiation process (both borne out by recent exclusives in The Hindu) and the merits of awarding large ancillary contracts to a newly-formed company with no established domain expertise.The larger point is that Jaitley’s blogs impart a technical-intellectual veneer to the BJP’s positions. And this veneer is important – for it comforts individuals and leads them to think that they are not blind in their endorsement of the establishment.It is not a contribution to be underestimated, especially at a time when a large section of the media is reluctant to interrogate those in power.More Than Meets the EyeIf Jaitley’s blogs have been the generator of reasonable-sounding talking points for one kind of BJP supporter, Jaitley’s persona – Delhi-elite, networked-but-lacking-janaadhar – is the punching bag that has taken the punches that another kind of BJP supporter – the disappointed kind, has been looking to throw, but is reluctant to direct at the prime minister.To such minds, demonetisation and GST were PM Modi’s masterstrokes that were stymied by his finance minister’s ineptitude – and corruption, middlemen and crony capitalism have not disappeared despite Modi’s best efforts, because the finance minister did not push hard enough.But the truth is much more complicated than that – demonetisation and GST were not well thought out, and corruption is too complex and embedded a phenomenon to wish away from a pulpit – but Jaitley has been the soft target soaking an anger that may otherwise have singed his prime minister.Jaitley’s Dual Role: Shock-Absorber &amp; SpinmeisterThe roles of spinmeister and shock-absorber that Jaitley has taken on are tough, and he has risked the opprobrium of party men and opponents alike. It may be a role he chose for himself to remain relevant in a dispensation that does not trust people like him.Or it may be a role that the party has entrusted to him. Or it may just be a role that happened with time. Whatever the case may be, Jaitley has gamely tried patching the chinks in his party, government and leader’s armour.Whether that will be enough to trump karma and a galvanised Opposition at the hustings will be discovered soon enough.(Manish Dubey is a policy analyst and crime fiction writer, and can be reached on Twitter at @ManishDubey1972.

301,"India, China Leading Global Greening Effort: NASA Study","India and China are leading the global greening effort, which is quite contrary to the general perception worldwide, a latest NASA study said on Monday, observing that the world is a greener place than it was 20 years ago.The NASA study based on data received and analysed from its satellite said that India and China are leading in greening on land. “China and India account for one-third of the greening but contain only 9 per cent of the planet’s land area covered in vegetation,” said lead author Chi Chen of Boston University.“That is a surprising finding, considering the general notion of land degradation in populous countries from over exploitation,” he said.The study published on February 11, in the journal Nature Sustainability said that recent satellite data (2000-2017) reveal a greening pattern that is strikingly prominent in China and India and overlaps with croplands worldwide.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
China alone accounts for 25 per cent of the global net increase in leaf area with only 6.6 per cent of the global vegetated area.The greening in China is from forests (42 per cent) and croplands (32 per cent), but in India, it is mostly from croplands (82 per cent) with a minor contribution from forests (4.4 per cent), the NASA study said.China is engineering ambitious programmes to conserve and expand forests with the goal of mitigating land degradation, air pollution and climate change.Food production in China and India has increased by over 35 per cent since 2000 mostly owing to an increase in the harvested area through multiple cropping facilitated by fertiliser use and surface- and/or groundwater irrigation.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
“When the greening of the Earth was first observed, we thought it was due to a warmer, wetter climate and fertilization from the added carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,” said Rama Nemani, a research scientist at NASA’s Ames Research Center and a co-author of the study.This study was made possible thanks to a two-decade-long data record from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites. “Now with the MODIS data, we see that humans are also contributing,” she said.Observing that once people realise there is a problem, they tend to fix it, Nemani said in the 1970s and 80s in India and China, the situation around vegetation loss was not good.“In the 1990s, people realized it, and today things have improved. Humans are incredibly resilient. That’s what we see in the satellite data,” she said.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
According to the paper, how the greening trend may change in the future depends on numerous factors.For example, increased food production in India is facilitated by groundwater irrigation. If the groundwater is depleted, this trend may change, it said.The researchers also pointed out that the gain in greenness around the world does not necessarily offset the loss of natural vegetation in tropical regions such as Brazil and Indonesia. There are consequences for sustainability and biodiversity in those ecosystems beyond the simple greenness of the landscape, the research study said."

303,"‘Chowkidar’ Is Pure, Will Become PM For Sure: Rajnath Singh","Moradabad : Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday denounced Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s persistent ‘chowkidar chor hai’ jibe against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and coined a rhyming slogan in his defence.While addressing a rally here, Singh said that the Prime Minister is not a “chor” (thief) but “pure and that he is the only “cure” for the country.Addressing a gathering here, he said, ‘Main kehna chahta hoon chowkidaar chor nahi hai, balki hamara chowkidaar pure hai. Agli baar uska PM banna sure hai, aur yahi Bharat ki samasyaon ka cure hai.’ (I want to say that our ‘chowkidaar’ is not a thief but is an honest man. He will be the PM for the next time for sure and that is the cure for all problems in India .)Singh’s remark comes after Rahul Gandhi on Monday continued his “chowkidar chor hai” barb, in a veiled reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that his party would not sit idle until a government based on Congress ideology is formed in Uttar Pradesh.Attacking the Prime Minister, Rahul alleged: “The country’s ‘chowkidar’ looted the people of Uttar Pradesh, the Air Force and others in the country.

304,5 Things To Know About The Next-Gen Mahindra XUV500,"It’s been almost a decade since Mahindra XUV500 is around, eight years to be specific as it was launched back in 2011. Although, it received a couple of facelifts, one in 2015 while another in 2018, it is about time for Mahindra to introduce the next-gen model of the mid-size SUV.Last year, the Indian automaker gave us clues of it being launched by 2020 and that will be co-developed with SsangYong. Mahindra is currently working with SsangYong to develop the new XUV300 and Alturas G4 that will be based on SsangYong Tivoli and Rexton respectively. This makes even more pronounced about Mahindra and SsangYong working on introducing the new XUV500 as well which is expected to be on similar lines as the SsangYong Korando.Here are the top five things you should know about the next-gen Mahindra XUV500.DesignThe new SsangYong Korando is based on the company’s latest e-SIV concept, which debuted at the Geneva Motor Show 2018. With future propositions linked to Korando and XUV500, it is expected that Mahindra won’t alter a bit from the Korando’s design for its mid-size SUV. Heavy side haunches are expected on the production-ready model though that can be seen on the concept as well as the Tivoli and XUV300.FeaturesThe outgoing version of Mahindra XUV500 is already loaded with features and we expect the same to continue. Over its current list of features that includes a 7-inch touchscreen system with Android Auto, a sunroof, power adjustable driver seat, and tan-leather upholstery, it is expected to feature up to 9 airbags, a 360-degree camera and a bigger 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system.EngineThe next-gen XUV500 is expected to get the Korando’s new 2.0-litre diesel BSVI compliant engine under the bonnet, mated to an automatic gearbox. The outgoing Korando houses 2.2-litre engine which is said to be replaced by the aforementioned smaller displacement engine.As far as petrol is concerned, the Mahinda XUV500 would be benefitted from the new 1.5-litre turbocharged power mill that is co-developed by Mahindra and SsangYong and would power the new Marazzo as well.ElectrificationLike its sibling XUV300, the XUV500 is also expected to get electrified powertrain options. A fully-electric option can be on the cards. Back in 2012, the company showcased an electric version of the current Korando, dubbed as the Korando E Concept, which leaves us with clues to relate to, isn’t it?Price and competitionCurrently, the Mahindra XUV500 retails in the price bracket of Rs 12.72 to Rs 18.28 lakh (Ex-showroom Delhi) and we expect the next-gen to be priced likewise. However, we expect the entry-level prices to go up considering the inclusion of BSVI compliant engines. In the Indian market, the mid-size SUV will compete against the likes of the Jeep Compass, the Tata Harrier, the Hyundai Tucson, and the MG Hector.Launch dateThe all-new Mahindra XUV500 is likely to be introduced in 2020, whereas the fourth-gen Korando is all set to debut at the upcoming Geneva Motor Show 2019 in March. The SsangYong Korando is likely to go on sale in Europe and other parts of the world by the end of this year."

308,Berlinale 2019: An Insider’S Guide To Getting Your Film Noticed,"Day One: A rocky start for me. Learnt an important lesson – when Germans say 8:45pm, they mean 8:40pm not 9pm. I was the last one to enter and it was a sit down. Once I had suitably apologised, I looked around. 24 people from 24 different countries and all looked very impressive. As the evening progressed a realisation dawned – they were as excited and as clueless as me. I was going to fit right in.Filmmaker Paakhi Tyrewala shares her experience at the Berlin International Film Festival 2019.Day Two: 8:45am is the first session; I have taken my seat at 8:40pm. Our first session is with Dorothee Wenner, a member of the selection committee. If you don’t know who she is, you should. She is an expert on sub-Saharan Africa and India, making her the most powerful person in India when it comes to selections for Berlinale. Her recommendations are highly valued, so if you want to impress someone, it’s her.She described Berlinale as sexy, edgy and aggressive and that’s pretty much what they are looking for in their films they select. I would personally add political.To understand Berlinale, you must understand Berlin. They have a history of colonisation and Holocaust, which they are ashamed of, and the bringing down of the Berlin Wall that they are proud of. In World War II, they were ruined to the ground. They have been the aggressor and the victim. Post the war, Germany was divided into East and West. The line went through Berlin. One side was socialism and other democracy/capitalism. This is the closest America and Russia came to each other during the Cold War. Separated only by a line, and later a wall. This made Berlin politically progressive and charged but it also made then aggressive (not violent) and opinionated and I say that positively.Inside Pics: Alia, Ranveer, Zoya at Berlin Film FestivalHow to Get Your Film Noticed at the BerlinaleThis in turn gave Berlinale a political air it carries.Germany desires to be the new leader of the free thinkers and those are the kind of filmmakers the festival wants to give a platform to.So, if you are making a fairy tale, however good it is, you are likely to not get selected. On the other hand, if your film is dealing with issues that impact the world – feminism, fascism, racism, dictatorship, freedom of speech, female infanticide, homelessness, child abuse – basically any revolutionary idea, chances are you will be considered. Along with that, if it’s sexy edgy and aggressive, your chances go up.It is also important for your film to be either a world premiere or an international premiere.A world premiere is when the movie has not released anywhere. Gully Boy, for instance, has its world premiere at Berlinale 2019. An international premiere is when the movie has released in the home country but nowhere else. So, as a filmmaker, be very cautious of the festivals you debut your films at.The Selection ProcessYou can choose to send in a blind entry, i.e. when you send your movie through without a box or freeway. Dorothy assured us that they watch every movie that is submitted. Some in the group were less convinced than other about that. In her defence, she did say they do not watch the entire movie. If it does not intrigue them in the first 30 minutes, they stop watching. Let’s assume it’s closer to 15 minutes then.So, the first five minutes of the movie are extremely crucial – her words not mine.Members of the selection committee also scout for movies round the year. In our case, that’s Dorothee. The entire group agreed that most of the films that get selected are through this route. Which means she comes to India, watches movies and networks with people who have attended the festivals. There have been instances where films get selected even before they are completed. Another name that came up for Indian selection process is film curator and critic Meenakshi Shedde.‘Gully Boy’ Review: Ranveer’s Intense Performance Steals the ShowNow, let’s not get disappointed. Networking doesn’t always mean having to do the rounds of various parties to get yourself noticed by the right people. Sometimes it’s as simple as getting in touch over email and keeping them posted about your project at various stages.If you feel intimidated doing all this by yourself, there is another way – festival agents. We have a few good ones in India and you can also choose to find yourself international agent.My take: Do not waste your money on blind submissions. If you are going to get representation, get it at an earlier stage and do not wait for the film to be over. Best to keep in touch with the folks behind the Berlinale. All the information you need to do that is there on their website.(Paakhi A. Tyrewala is a filmmaker who is part of a special delegation at the Berlin International Film Festival. She is sending special despatches on her experience at understanding the prestigious festival.)"
309,‘Roma’ Takes Bafta Glory In Coup For Netflix,"London: Netflix black-and-white production “Roma” triumphed at the Bafta film awards, boosting Oscar hopes for the US streaming giant whose rise poses a serious challenge to the conventional Hollywood business model.The cinematic love letter to director Alfonso Cuaron’s 1970s childhood in Mexico City beat black comedy “The Favourite” to win best film and best director.“I’m seriously touched this film has been received the way it’s been received,” Cuaron said at a star-studded ceremony on Sunday in London’s Royal Albert Hall, also attended by Prince William and his wife Kate.Cuaron thanked Netflix for “having the courage” to get behind his film as he picked up the gong, adding that its success “in an age where fear and anger are proposed to divide us means the world to me”.“Roma” portrays domestic strife and social hierarchy amid political turmoil and focuses on a housekeeper and nanny called Cleo, played by indigenous actress Yalitza Aparicio.Bafta-winning ‘Roma’ is a cinematic love letter to director Alfonso Cuaron’s childhood in Mexico City in the 1970s (AFP)Netflix UK tweeted its congratulations, saying it was a “deeply moving film and deserves all the love it’s getting”.It dented expectations of a clean sweep by “The Favourite” which picked up best actress for Olivia Colman as Queen Anne and best supporting actress for Rachel Weisz playing her confidante and lover.The film, about a cantankerous 18th-century British queen and her scheming court, had been nominated for 12 awards and picked up seven in what Colman described as an “amazing night” for the cast.“This is for all three of us. It’s got my name on it but we can scratch on some other ones,” she said on stage, also referring to co-star Emma Stone who was nominated in the same category as Weisz.Colman, 45, was up against Glenn Close (“The Wife”) and Lady Gaga (“A Star is Born”) – the same power duo she will face at the Oscars on February 24, with Close so far the clear frontrunner.“She doesn’t take herself too seriously and she enjoys what she’s doing,” Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos said of Colman.Weisz and Stone are also in the running for Oscars in a proud year for the British film industry.Red carpet for Netflix?“Roma” is up for best picture at the Oscars – Netflix’s first-ever nomination which has propelled it into the Hollywood club of elite filmmakers.While the online service has gradually been welcomed at most major film festivals, Tinseltown’s red carpet is not fully rolled out, with cinemas up in arms about its position as a distribution king attracting A-list stars.After the Oscar nominations were announced, theatre mega-chains AMC and Regal – the top two in America by far – said “Roma” would not be screened in their annual best-picture showcases.In all, “Roma” was shown in around 900 theatres worldwide – more than any other Netflix film, but far short of a usual big release. Netflix never released any box office data.While Netflix has made some good-faith efforts to gain Hollywood’s acceptance, it only waited three weeks after the theatre release of “Roma” to make it available on its platform, far less than the 90 days that cinema owners ask studios to hold back.‘Serious allegations’Last year’s Bafta ceremony saw Hollywood stars paint the red carpet black in solidarity with the #MeToo movement.The 2019 edition has also been tinged by scandal.US actor Rami Malek’s portrayal of the late Queen frontman Freddie Mercury earned him the best actor award (AFP)Bafta removed “Bohemian Rhapsody” director Bryan Singer from the Queen biopic’s citation in the outstanding British film nomination “in light of recent very serious allegations”.That referred to an article in US magazine The Atlantic detailing sexual misconduct allegations that included underage sex.Singer denies the story and the film itself was still up for the award, although it failed to win.Rami Malek’s portrayal of the late Queen frontman Freddie Mercury – a victim of the AIDS epidemic in the days when homosexuality was taboo in rock-and-roll – earned him the best actor award, however.After winning he paid tribute to Mercury as “the greatest outsider of them all”.Having seen off Christian Bale’s transformation into former US vice-president Dick Cheney in “Vice”, Malek’s victory may boost his chances at the Oscars.The two are both in the running for best actor, with Bradley Cooper also nominated for “A Star is Born” in an increasingly tight race as final voting opens Tuesday and closes February 19.The awards were attended by Prince William and his wife Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (AFP)Best supporting actor at the Baftas went to Mahershala Ali for “Green Book”, a comedy-drama in which he plays a jazz pianist on a tour of America’s Deep South in 1962.“Free Solo” – a film about the first person to climb El Capitan in Yosemite National Park without ropes – won the award for best documentary.Among the glitzy crowd there was one star missing – Lady Gaga, who won the best original music award for “A Star is Born”, was instead performing at the Grammys in Los Angeles, where she picked up three gongs."
310,"Ayushmann Khurrana Helped Me To Identify Myself, Says Hum Chaar Star Prit Kamani","Prit Kamani, who is playing Namit in the film considers ‘Hum Chaar’ very close to his heart.Mumbai: Rajshri Production’s upcoming film Hum Chaar is turning out to be the launch pad for four new faces in Bollywood. Among all four of them, Prit Kamani, who is playing Namit in the film considers Hum Chaar very close to his heart.In a chat with Deccan Chronicle, Prit said, “Hum Chaar is very close to my heart as this is my first film and special one of course. I didn’t even notice when we completed the entire shoot as we lived together as a family.”Hum Chaar castPrit started his career as a TV host which is quite similar to popular actor Ayushmann Khurrana.

I would always share a lot of things about work.”When I was struggling, he advised me that I should identify myself and be the way I am in real life. If you find yourself then others would automatically find you. His advice really helped me a lot,” Prit added.Now, Prit has worked in both TV and films. While speaking about the difference, Prit mentioned, “The work process between both the medium is same but the execution is different. My work was to listen to what my director wants from him on-screen. I have always tried to deliver whatever my director expect from me. You should be honest with your work.”Apart from Prit, Anushuman Malhotra, Tushar Pandey and Simran Sharma are also making their debut from Hum Chaar.

312,Craig McMillan To Quite As New Zealand Batting Coach After 2019 World Cup,"Wellington: Former international Craig McMillan announced Monday he will step down as New Zealand batting coach after this year’s World Cup in England and Wales. McMillan said the conclusion of the showpiece tournament was the right time to move on after five years in the job, including helping New Zealand reach the final of the 2015 World Cup.“It’s been a privilege to be able to work with the likes of Brendon McCullum, Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor day-in and day-out and to see the records they’ve accomplished has been very satisfying,” he said.McMillan, who played 55 Tests and 197 one-day internationals for the Black Caps, was given the role of batting mentor by former head coach Mike Hesson, who was replaced by Gary Stead last year.The 42-year-old said he would pursue other coaching opportunities after the World Cup but did not specify what they might be. The tournament runs from May 30 to July 14 and New Zealand Cricket said McMillan’s replacement would be announced before the team depart for a tour of Sri Lanka in August."
313,Man City Hit Chelsea For A Six,"London: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero struck his second hat-trick in a week as the champions ruthlessly destroyed Sunday a woeful Chelsea in a 6-0 win at The Etihad to return to the top of the Premier League. This triumph over a club in the top six of the points table was an emphatic statement of City’s title aspirations.In the past week City have beaten Arsenal at home and Everton away before taking Maurizio Sarri’s side to pieces with four goals in the opening 25 minutes.“Incredible week, incredible game,” said manager Pep Guardiola. “To score six against Chelsea and the way we played, we had so much attention (to detail). We did it, it’s an incredible compliment to the players, they are outstanding,” added the Spaniard.City have now scored 33 goals in their last five home games in all competitions. They and Liverpool are both on 65 points with City having the better goal difference. Third-placed Tottenham Hotspur, who beat Leicester City 3-1 earlier Sunday, are five points behind.Aguero, who scored a hat-trick seven days ago against Arsenal, has equalled Alan Shearer’s record of 11 Premier League hat-tricks and is now joint top scorer in the league this season with Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah on 17 goals.Chelsea had no time to settle before Raheem Sterling fired City ahead in the fourth minute with a side-foot finish after a quick free-kick from Kevin De Bruyne caught the visiting defence napping.Aguero then got into the act when he beat Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga with a blistering strike from 25 metres, underlining the fact that he is far more than a penalty area poacher.A poor header by Chelsea’s Ross Barkley towards his own goal gifted Aguero with City’s third, the Argentine firing home with a first-time shot on the turn, and then a low drive from Ilkay Gundogan made it 4-0 after 25 minutes.Guardiola had left David Silva on the bench but his midfield looked perfectly balanced with De Bruyne and Gundogan providing a presence in the middle and Bernardo Silva, who seems to get better with every game, in imperious form on the right flank.Following the break, Aguero, who also became City’s all-time top scorer in league games, headed against the bar before he completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot after Sterling had been brought down by Cesar Azpilicueta.Sterling completed the rout, turning in a low cross from Oleksandr Zinchenko in the 80th.“It is one of the worst nights in my career. It is difficult to explain what happened,” said Chelsea captain Azpilicueta."
314,Angel Di Maria With Point To Prove On Return To Old Trafford With PSG,"Paris: An expensive flop who lasted just a single season at Manchester United, Angel di Maria might be keen to prove a point when he goes back to Old Trafford as a Paris Saint-Germain player on Tuesday.The Argentine, who turns 31 later this week, has a vital role to play for PSG in their crunch Champions League last 16, first leg against a resurgent United with Neymar and Edinson Cavani out injured.Those absences will place even more of an onus on Di Maria to show why PSG were prepared to make him their superstar signing in the summer of 2015, two years before Neymar and Kylian Mbappe arrived in the French capital.The former Benfica and Real Madrid man cost United a British record transfer fee of just under GBP 60 million (almost 75 million euros at the time) in 2014, but he was an unmitigated failure in England.Di Maria scored only three times in 27 Premier League appearances in 2014/15 for a United side who finished fourth, a long way behind champions Chelsea.His time in England was also marred by an attempted burglary on his family’s home outside Manchester that reportedly left his wife and daughter terrified, and keen to get away.Played out of positionHis manager that year, Louis van Gaal, had hailed Di Maria as “world class” on his arrival, but their relationship quickly turned sour, with the player blaming the Dutchman for playing him out of position.“I only stayed one year. It wasn’t the best period of my career, or they didn’t let me have my best time there,” Di Maria said in a recent interview with radio station France Bleu.“There were problems with the coach at the time. But thanks to God, I was able to come to PSG and be myself again.”United made a loss when they sold Di Maria for 63 million euros (GBP 44.3 million at the time), but it was very much PSG’s gain.Nicknamed ‘El Fideo’ (The Noodle)in Spain for his slender frame, Di Maria is in his fourth season in Paris and recently extended his contract to 2021.He has scored or created more than 70 goals in Ligue 1 for PSG, although he was signed chiefly to win big Champions League games and has been unable to prevent his side being knocked out in the last 16 in each of the last two seasons.Happy under TuchelNevertheless, if Di Maria’s days in Paris seemed numbered after Neymar and Mbappe signed in mega-bucks deals at the start of last season, he ended up being one of his team’s most consistent performers in the last campaign.Since then, the appointment of Thomas Tuchel has coach has only helped a player who can perform in central midfield as well as on the wing.And if Tuchel’s side are to overcome their injury problems and come away from Old Trafford in a strong position before next month’s second leg in Paris, they will need Di Maria to show the United fans what they are missing.“He was one of my favourite players when I used to watch him on television,” Tuchel said at the start of this season after making it clear that Di Maria was just as important to him as the ‘MCN’ front three of Mbappe, Neymar and Edinson Cavani.“He is a gift for me. Everything is very easy with him because he is a top professional. He has extraordinary quality and works so hard for the team.”"

The sanctions, aimed at blocking Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s access to the nation’s oil revenue, will be extended to non-U.S. oil buyers from April 28, potentially stopping them from paying for Venezuelan oil in U.S. dollars.Elsewhere, uncertainty over whether Washington will in May extend waivers to sanctions on Tehran’s oil exports that it previously granted to top Iranian crude buyers – China, India, Japan and South Korea – is also boosting Middle East oil prices.And a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to rein in oil output has buoyed sour crude prices as well.

GRAPHIC: Sour crude prices rise above Brent https://tmsnrt.rs/2TBR6JBMISSION TO BUY MARSStrong demand from the United States for heavy oil to replace Venezuelan supplies has boosted prices for U.S. Mars crude and Latin American grades, restricting supplies of those cargoes to Asia, traders said.Offers of Mars crude for April delivery to North Asia have risen more than $1 a barrel, while spot premiums for Latin American grades such as Castilla from Colombia, have climbed by $2 a barrel, traders said.Castilla was sold out even before its loading programme was released, said one of the traders. The sources declined to be identified as they were not autthorised to speak with media.U.S. refiners are also seeking more supplies from the Middle East, creating a pull for such barrels at a time when Asia’s sour oil demand is growing as two new refineries have started trial runs in China and Malaysia.Meanwhile, refiners globally are also processing more medium and heavy crude to reap higher profits from fuel oil and middle distillates. That has kept the price gap between Saudi’s Arab Light and Arab Heavy crude in Asia close to the narrowest in a decade.“Heavy sour strength is bolstered through the first-half of 2019 by continued complex refinery capacity growth and tight fuel oil markets, before IMO 2020 presents a cliff for (high-sulphur fuel oil) demand,” Citi analysts said.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 250px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:250px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:250px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>

320,"‘PM Not Following Raj Dharma’: Andhra CM, On Fast Seeking Special Status","New Delhi: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu launched into a tirade against the BJP-led central government, alleging Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not following ‘raj dharma’ by denying the state special status.Naidu, who began a day-long fast at the Andhra Bhavan demanding that the Centre fulfil all promises made during AP’s bifurcation in 2014, warned that Modi would be given a befitting answer if he made personal attacks against the people of his state.“(Former PM) Atal Bihari Vajpayee said ‘raj dharma’ was not followed in Gujarat (during the 2002 riots). Now, ‘raj dharma’ is not being followed in the case of Andhra Pradesh. We have been denied what is rightfully ours,” Naidu said.He alleged the central government did grave injustice to Andhra and it would have “repercussions on national unity”.“On behalf of five crore people, I’m warning this government… I came here to remind you of the promises made in the AP Reorganisation Act,” Naidu said.“I am warning you. Don’t make personal attacks against me and my people. It’s unwarranted. I am just doing my duty as the head of my state. We are only demanding what we were promised,” he said, adding if somebody “attacks our self respect, we will not tolerate it”.The TDP chief said the party was denied permission to stage a protest in Parliament premises. “So, we came here”.A number of opposition party leaders, including Congress president Rahul Gandhi, National Conference’s Farooq Abdullah and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, are expected to extend their support to the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief’s fast.Before beginning the fast, Naidu offered tributes to Matama Gandhi at Raj Ghat and to B R Ambedkar at Andhra Pradesh Bhavan. A TDP delegation led by Naidu will submit a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday, party sources said.Naidu has been trying to unite opposition parties to take on the BJP in the general elections. Over the last three months, he has held a number of meetings with opposition party leaders on forming an anti-BJP front.The TDP had in March last year pulled out of the NDA government over its refusal to grant special status to Andhra Pradesh. The party has been accusing the Modi government of not releasing enough funds for the Polavaram irrigation project, the Kadapa steel plant and Amravati, the under-construction ultra-modern state capital."

Washington suspended plans in December to increase tariffs on USD 200 billion worth of Chinese imports – to 25 per cent from the current 10 per cent – to give negotiators space to resolve a trade spat that has triggered fears of a global economic slowdown.A previous round of talks in Washington last month ended without a deal.

The Chinese delegation will be led by Vice Premier Liu He, who will be joined by central bank governor Yi Gang. Liu, China’s chief trade negotiator, met last month with Trump, who announced that a final resolution of the trade dispute would depend on a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping “in the near future.”But Trump said Thursday he did not expect to meet his Chinese counterpart before the trade truce expires on March 1. The Trump administration is demanding far-reaching changes from China to address commercial practices that it says are deeply unfair, including theft of American intellectual property and myriad barriers that US and other foreign companies face in the Chinese domestic market."

Jubeir was interviewed Friday, the same day President Donald Trump ignored a congressional deadline for reporting on who assassinated Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post who had been openly critical of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.The CIA has concluded the Saudi operation was likely directed by the powerful crown prince, but the White House has sidestepped that finding amid strenuous denials by Riyadh, a key US ally.On Friday, The New York Times said the CIA had intercepted communications of the crown prince telling a top aide in 2017 that he would go after Khashoggi “with a bullet” if the journalist did not return to Saudi Arabia.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 250px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:250px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:250px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>

329,"Walter Jones, Veteran US Congressman From North Carolina, Dies At 76","WASHINGTON: Walter B. Jones, a veteran Republican US congressman from North Carolina, died on Sunday at age 76, his office said, three weeks after suffering a broken hip at his home. Jones was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1995 and had been a member of the House Committee on Armed Services, instrumental in sponsoring legislation about veterans.Jones, who died in Greenville, North Carolina, had entered hospice at the end of January after his health deteriorated following a broken hip and subsequent surgery, according to his web site. “He was known for his independence, and widely admired across the political spectrum,” his office said in a statement.Once a vocal supporter of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Jones later regretted his championing of the war and wrote to the families of US service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. “I have signed over 12,000 letters to families and extended families who`ve lost loved ones in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and that was for me asking God to forgive me for my mistake,” Jones told NPR in 2017."
330,"Priyanka’S ‘Mission UP’ Begins Today With Lucknow, Rahul Says ‘Excited’","New Delhi: Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the Congress general secretary incharge of east UP, will be arriving in Lucknow today for her visit to the politically crucial state after formally joining politics.The grand roadshow is likely to and pass through places such as Hussainganj and Hazratganj before culminating at the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee office.Priyanka and Scindia will stay in the state for next three days to hold meetings with office bearers and chalking out strategy for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.Priyanka’s entry into active politics is likely to pose fresh challenges to the ruling BJP that has won 71 of the 80 seats in UP.

The Congress had secured only two seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections."

332,Passengers Cannot `opt Out` Meals On Board Vande Bharat Express,"Meals on board the soon-to-be-launched Vande Bharat Express or Train 18 will not be optional for passengers unlike in premium trains such as Shatabdi, Rajdhani and Duronto express, where travellers can choose not to take catering services, officials said. However, passengers travelling the last leg on the route of the semi-high speed train — Allahabad to Varanasi — will have the choice of opting out of the meals provided by the Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), in advance while booking their tickets, the sources said.The catering charges would not be included in their ticket prices. For others, the prices of the meals will be part of the ticket fare of the train which will run from Varanasi to Delhi on its maiden journey on February 15. If the passengers who have opted out in advance want a meal during their travel, they will have to shell out an extra Rs 50 for it, the sources said. In 2017, the IRCTC made meals on board prepaid trains like Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duronto (which add the meal prices in ticket) with pantry services optional.It was done to effectively control unfair practices of overcharging, issues of quality as well quantity and also to avoid wastage of food. This gave the passengers option to ‘not eat’ if he does not want the food supplied on board. This also reduced the cost of the tickets on these trains by around Rs 250. Talking about Train 18, an official said, “The catering charges between the stations have been fixed and they will be added to the ticket fare of all passengers. “However, passengers boarding the train to travel the final or first leg of the journey from Varanasi to Allahabad or Allahabad to Varanasi may opt out of the catering services. They will have to opt out at the time of booking.”“A separate receipt shall be issued to such passengers by the IRCTC,” the source said. The train which has two classes of tickets — executive class and chair car — will have differently priced meals, the source said. While passengers travelling from New Delhi to Varanasi in the executive class will be charged Rs 399 for morning tea, breakfast and lunch, travellers in the chair car will need to pay Rs 344 for the same. Those travelling from New Delhi to Kanpur and Prayagraj will have to pay Rs 155 and Rs 122 for executive class and chair car, respectively. From Varanasi to New Delhi, the passengers will be charged Rs 349 and Rs 288 in the executive class and chair, respectively.They will be served evening tea with snacks and dinner. The tickets in Train 18 or the Vande Bharat Express, which will eventually replace Shatabdi trains, will be priced higher than the fares of the premium train. The train will cover the 755-km distance in eight hours with stoppages at Kanpur and Prayagraj. It will be the fastest train on the route. The current fastest train takes around 11-and-a-half-hours to complete the journey."

Brexit has divided Britain at every level from voters to cabinet, and raised fears internationally that it will weaken the West. Brexit supporters hail it as casting off a failing German-led project.Last week, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn set out the conditions under which he would instruct his party to support an exit deal in parliament. Foremost was a demand that May seek a “permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union”.The EU has urged May to grasp Labour’s compromise offer rather than press ahead with her preferred option of getting her own divided party onside by renegotiating a clause in the exit agreement relating to the Northern Irish border.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_2_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_2_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_2"" name=""aswift_2"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=3085528189&amp;adf=4000142532&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.9~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615635048&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fuks-may-rejects-pivot-towards-brexit-customs-union-compromise%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615635048474&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=889&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3Deafdd17184735fc7-22fb57f5cac60034%3AT%3D1615635015%3ART%3D1615635015%3AS%3DALNI_MbEKHLMnixa1ArBpSIIo4u-qENuSA&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C699x280&amp;nras=3&amp;correlator=2841246490299&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1710627194.1615635011&amp;ga_sid=1615635048&amp;ga_hid=749802769&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=6&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1577&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=21066109%2C21066111%2C21067213%2C21068083&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=3092537717299413&amp;pem=112&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=3&amp;uci=a!3&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=tVVXAQJGbK&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=28"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!3"" data-google-query-id=""COf0lMqVre8CFYKNmgodu-oNUA"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
But May’s office published her reply to Corbyn late on Sunday, showing little appetite for a U-turn which would risk splitting her fractious party by ruling out the scope for Britain to strike its own trade deals around the world.“I am not clear why you believe it would be preferable to seek a say in future EU trade deals rather than the ability to strike our own deal?” May wrote in a three-page letter.May and her government have repeatedly said membership of a customs union would prevent it having an independent trade policy – something they have promoted as one of the main economic benefits of leaving the EU.Although May welcomed the prospect of future talks with Corbyn to try and find a compromise, the letter gave no ground on their central point of disagreement.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=3085528189&amp;adf=3340846887&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.17~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615635048&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Fuks-may-rejects-pivot-towards-brexit-customs-union-compromise%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615635048474&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=889&amp;idt=-M&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3Deafdd17184735fc7-22fb57f5cac60034%3AT%3D1615635015%3ART%3D1615635015%3AS%3DALNI_MbEKHLMnixa1ArBpSIIo4u-qENuSA&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C699x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=2841246490299&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=1710627194.1615635011&amp;ga_sid=1615635048&amp;ga_hid=749802769&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=6&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2205&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=21066109%2C21066111%2C21067213%2C21068083&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=3092537717299413&amp;pem=112&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=7xq732lBdd&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=33"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CJzZlcqVre8CFe6BmwodtSELCQ"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
That leaves May battling to persuade a reluctant EU to look again at the Irish backstop – a fallback policy designed to prevent the resurrection of a hard border in Ireland if talks to find a long-term trade arrangement fail.Brexit minister Stephen Barclay will meet EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday ahead of a crunch moment in parliament on Thursday, when lawmakers will try to force May to change course or give up control of the exit process.May will promise lawmakers a second opportunity to influence the Brexit talks later in the month in a bid to stave off any rebellion from within her own party by those who fear Britain could end up leaving without a deal."
334,Government Seeks Rs 1600 Crore To Pay EVM Suppliers,"The government has sought over Rs 1,637 crore in the current fiscal to allow the law ministry make payments to two suppliers of EVMs and paper trail machines ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. The government, in the third batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants for 2018-19, has sought Parliament’s approval for Rs 1,637.14 crore to allow the Law Ministry pay Electronics Corporation of India Ltd and Bharat Electronics Ltd for electronic voting machines and paper trail machines, according to the document.The third batch of supplementary demands for grants will be passed by February 13 when the Budget session concludes. The two public sector undertakings tasked with manufacturing the latest M3 type EVMs to be used in Lok Sabha elections due this summer have delivered the lot comprising nearly 22.3 lakh ballot units and 16.3 lakh control units to theElection Commission. Around 22.3 lakh ballot units, 16.3 lakh control units and nearly 17.3 lakh VVPATs or paper trail machines will be used for the 2019 LS polls. The number of machines includes the buffer stock for training as well as replacements.These machines would be deployed at the nearly 10.6 lakh polling stations across India in the next parliamentary elections. The Bharat Electronics Ltd and the Electronics Corporation of India Ltd were mandated to deliver these machines to the poll panel by September 30, 2018. During simultaneous elections, two separate sets of EVMs are required, one for the parliamentary constituency and the other for legislative assembly constituency. In case of an error with the VVPAT, the machine is replaced with a reserve.But in case a ballot unit or control unit malfunctions, the entire set of ballot unit, control unit and VVPAT is replaced. Till date, EVMs have been used in 113 Assembly elections and three Lok Sabha elections since 2000. Amid demands by some opposition parties to go back to ballot papers, the Commission has maintained that use of EVMs has ended the days of booth capturing and the delays and errors in counting of ballot papers. Several parties have questioned the reliability of voting machines, alleging that they could be tampered with."
335,"Snowfall, Closed Highway Leads To Fuel Shortage In Kashmir","Srinagar, Feb 8: The closure of the arterial Jammu-Srinagar National Highway has led to depletion of fuel stocks in Kashmir, forcing the authorities to direct fuel pumps to provide only three litres petrol per vehicle per day, officials said on Friday.According to an order issued by Divisional Commissioner, Kashmir, Baseer Ahmad Khan, the fuel stations have also been directed not to provide more than 10 litres of diesel per commercial vehicle per day.“In view of the fast depletion of petrol products, MS and HSD and LPG, it is felt expedient to implement the rationing with respect to distribution of these products till such time the supply position improves after road opening,” Khan said in the order.Oil companies have been directed to restrict supply of petrol and diesel to fuel pumps to 1000 litres per day per station, according to the order.[Heavy snowfall severely effects plane movements in Srinagar; Many flights cancelled]They have also been told to reserve separate quota for government vehicles, ambulances, water tankers and snow clearance machines. The 265-kilometre Jammu-Srinagar road has remained closed for the most part in the past 11 days due to heavy snowfall coupled with avalanches and landslides at several places.It is completely closed for vehicular traffic since Wednesday. This closure of the road has also resulted in an abrupt rise in prices of food items like vegetables and fruits while mutton and poultry products are short in supply. The situation has also forced many car owners to use public transport while some others preferring to travel by foot."

337,Budget 2019:New Industrial Policy To Attract Investment,"The government will introduce a new industrial policy to attract investment in the state, the chief minister H D Kumaraswamy announced on Friday.Delivering the Budget speech, he said the government would also spend Rs 110 crore to continue “compete with China” scheme during 2019-20.“The existing 2014-2019 industrial policy will end in September 2019. The new policy aims at attracting investment, new technologies and generation of additional employment. It will be rolled out keeping in mind the comprehensive development of industries, especially to priority sectors in the backward areas of Tier-2 and Tier-3 centres,” Kumaraswamy said.As part of its plans to compete with China, the government will establish nine industrial clusters in nine districts. Vision groups have been constituted relating to such industries. The government is acting upon the reports of such vision groups, he said.“The investors are coming forward to establish industries in Koppal, Ballari and Kolar districts. In four and a half years, we expect that 1 lakh in each district amounting to a total 9 lakh employment generation will take place. To continue this scheme in the current year, Rs 110 crore is provided,” the chief minister said.The government also proposes to organise a ‘Global Capital Investment Conference’ in January 2020, he said.In an effort to promote setting up of industries across the state as part of its plans to decongest Bengaluru, the government intends to develop new industrial areas at Arasikere in Hassan district, Nagamangala in Mandya district, Chittapur in Kalaburagi district, Mulavad in Vijayapura district, Kanagala in Belagavi district and Madhugiri in Tumakuru district through the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board.The government also proposed to conduct the survey of leasing of mines using new drone technology and Global Positioning System (GPS) technology at a cost of Rs 82 crore for the first time, Kumaraswamy said.A ‘Tumakuru Industrial Node’ is being established in 9,629 acres at Vasanthnarasapur in Tumakuru district under the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor Project.A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) called CBIC, Tumakuru Industrial Township Limited has been established. To provide excellent quality infrastructure for the development of industries, a detailed plan is being prepared.With this, an estimated Rs 50,000 crore will be invested and 2 lakh employment will be provided, Kumaraswamy said.“Our government will take action to attract this mega investment and to provide effective and seamless public road and rail transport system. A rail-based efficient and useful multi-modal transport system between Vasanthnarasapur, Tumakuru, Ramanagara and Bengaluru on a separate track will be developed which will accelerate the economic growth of these areas,” he added."
338,Another Conclave Of Oppn Leaders Likely Next Week,"The national capital may play host to another Opposition congregation next week, against alleged misuse of probe agencies by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party to target its political opponents.The proposed protest demonstration in New Delhi may also be yet another show of Opposition unity, ahead of the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections. It is likely to be themed “Save Constitution, Save Democracy, Save Federalism”.Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress supremo, is likely to visit New Delhi early next week. Her Andhra Pradesh counterpart and Telugu Desam Party chief N Chandrababu Naidu is expected to join her on a sit-in demonstration on Wednesday or Thursday to protest alleged misuse of the Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to harass and intimidate the leaders of opposition parties. Chief Minister of Delhi and Aam Aadmi Party supremo, Arvind Kejriwal, is also likely to join.The Congress is learnt to be in touch with the Trinamool Congress. The two parties are discussing the possibility of Congress President Rahul Gandhi as well as the Chief Ministers of some Congress-ruled states joining the protest, sources told DH on Friday.The Trinamool Congress has also been in touch with Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party. According to the sources, senior leaders of the two parties may take part even if Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati do not.The leaders of National Conference, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Janata Dal (Secular) are also being counted.Focal pointBanerjee’s latest sit-in demonstration was in Kolkata to protest a move by the CBI to question city police commissioner Rajeev Kumar in connection with a chit fund scam, allegedly involving her party leaders.She drew flak from the ruling BJP but she reciprocated in equal measure and slammed the BJP government after the ED questioned Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi’s husband Robert Vadra in connection with a case of alleged money laundering on Wednesday.Her January 19 rally, which saw many Opposition leaders joining her in Kolkata, and the latest sit-in placed her at the centre of the yet-to-be formalised “mahagathbandhan” or great alliance of Opposition parties against the ruling BJP."

340,Divisional Status To Ladakh: Many Question Intentions,"The governor-led Jammu and Kashmir government’s decision to create a separate administrative/revenue division for the Ladakh region of the state has triggered similar demands from politicians questioning the intentions of New Delhi over the matter.The J&amp;K government on Friday approved the creation of the posts of Divisional Commissioner (Ladakh), Leh and Inspector General of Police (Ladakh), Leh besides constituting a committee to identify the posts of divisional level heads of various departments.The former chief minister and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said ignoring regions like Chenab Valley and Pir Panjal raises doubts of New Delhi’s intention. “Creation of a separate administrative division for Leh is a welcome step. However, ignoring Pir Panchal &amp; Chenab Valley raises questions about the Centre’s intention. Seems like Guv sb is peddling BJPs agenda by ignoring other equally deserving regions (sic),” she tweeted.Earlier, National Conference vice-president and former CM Omar Abdullah promised division status for Chenab Valley and Pir Panjal regions of Jammu, if his party was voted to power in upcoming Assembly elections.Ladakh is one of the most sparsely populated regions in Jammu and Kashmir and is the highest plateau in the state, with most of it being over 9,800 feet above sea level. It is geographically isolated with a sparse population and inhospitable terrain which remains landlocked for nearly six months in a year. The region is riddled with insurmountable problems with respect to delivery of developmental schemes, redressal of public grievances, the conduct of administrative affairs and governance as such.The people of Ladakh have, for a long time, been demanding effective local institutional arrangements which can help promote and accelerate the pace of development and equitable all-round growth and development having regard to its peculiar geo-climatic and topographic conditions, stimulate and seek the fullest participation of the local community in the decision-making process.At present, the powers of local governance have already been decentralised by the formation of Hill Development Councils for the Leh and Kargil districts. During winter months the entire Ladakh region, comprising both Leh and Kargil, remain cut-off from rest of the country for almost six months. Air travel via Leh is the only mode of transport available to this region, which makes it impossible for people to visit other parts of the country for various purposes.Currently, the Ladakh region forms a part of the Kashmir division."

The world court has halted Jadhav’s execution on India’s appeal pending the final verdict by it.ICJ to start final hearings on Kulbhushan Jadhav’s case from Feb 18Both India and Pakistan have already submitted their detailed pleas and responses in the world court and it has decided to hold hearings in the Jadhav case from February 18-21, 2019.India denies all the charges and maintains that Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran where he had business interests after retiring from the Navy and that he has no links with the government.In its written pleadings, India had accused Pakistan of violating the Vienna Convention by not giving consular access to Jadhav.In response, Pakistan through its counter-memorial told the ICJ that the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963 applied only to legitimate visitors and did not cover clandestine operations.India has been maintaining that the trial of Jadhav by a military court in Pakistan was “farcical”. Qureshi, who is on a visit to the UK, said that Pakistan has all the evidence against Jadhav.“Pakistan has all the evidence against Jadhav of sabotage activities inside Pakistan. Jadhav has admitted to being involved in such activities. Pakistan’s legal team will present its stance in the case at The Hague on the 19th of this month,” the Geo News quoted Qureshi as saying at a reception in Manchester.Here is the evidence Pakistan claims it has against Kulbhushan Jadhav“Pakistan’s legal team will present its stance in the case that the Indian spy has already confessed of being involved in terrorist activities carried out in Pakistan,” another paper, the Express Tribune quoted him as saying.Pakistan says its security forces arrested Jadhav from Balochistan province in March 2016 after he reportedly entered the country from Iran.In its submission to the ICJ, Pakistan had stated that Jadhav is not an ordinary person as he had entered the country with the intent of spying and carrying out sabotage activities."

An identical bill – Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act (HR 1044) — was tabled in the US House of Representatives by Congressman Zoe Lofgren and Ken Buck, Chair and Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship, with co-sponsorship of a bipartisan group of 112 Congressmen. If passed by Congress and signed into law, the legislations would benefit thousands of Indian professionals on H-1B visas whose current wait time for permanent legal residency is more than a decade.The H-1B visa, most sought-after among Indian IT professionals, is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.Having a Green Card (officially known as a Permanent Resident Card) allows a person to live and work permanently in the United States.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=2409899742&amp;adf=2182357697&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.7~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615635148&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Flaws-to-end-per-country-green-card-limits-proposed-in-us%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615635148150&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=874&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D48c7f34d3e8bb0c2-228240c4dbc60051%3AT%3D1615635117%3ART%3D1615635117%3AS%3DALNI_Ma6XsDHxgUlFQib8e2Q-hJuJA_6Mg&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1034x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=5818797623881&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=885501917.1615635115&amp;ga_sid=1615635148&amp;ga_hid=440411951&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=6&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2008&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=42530671%2C31060305&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=712954846518806&amp;pem=89&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=oEo7fQ0atA&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=35"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CKHA0vmVre8CFWLrWwodyRMMyA"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
According to some recent studies, some categories of those Indian professionals face a wait of 151 years under the current system which imposes a country cap on people who get green cards.The United States makes currently 140,000 green cards available every year to employment-based immigrants, including many who first come here on temporary H-1B or L visas.The existing law, however, provides that not more than seven percent of these green cards can go to nationals of any one country – even though some countries are more populous than others.Because of this seven percent limit, for example, a Chinese or Indian post-graduate may have to wait half a decade or more for a Green Card, much longer than a student from a less-populated country.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_4"" name=""aswift_4"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=2409899742&amp;adf=1967714717&amp;pi=t.aa~a.249833192~i.13~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615635148&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Flaws-to-end-per-country-green-card-limits-proposed-in-us%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615635148153&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=878&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D48c7f34d3e8bb0c2-228240c4dbc60051%3AT%3D1615635117%3ART%3D1615635117%3AS%3DALNI_Ma6XsDHxgUlFQib8e2Q-hJuJA_6Mg&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1034x280%2C699x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=5&amp;correlator=5818797623881&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=885501917.1615635115&amp;ga_sid=1615635148&amp;ga_hid=440411951&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=6&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2074&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=42530671%2C31060305&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=712954846518806&amp;pem=89&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=5&amp;uci=a!5&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=9J4rPikQ0q&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=784"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!5"" data-google-query-id=""CImZgfqVre8CFUXCWwod3XUN_w"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
“Ours is a nation of immigrants, and our strength has always come from our diversity and our unity,” Harris said.Kamala Harris, Senator”We must do more to eliminate discriminatory backlogs and facilitate family unity so that high-skilled immigrants are not vulnerable to exploitation and can stay in the US and continue to contribute to the economy.”Co-sponsored by 13 more Senators, the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act increases the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from seven percent to 15 percent.Without adding any new green cards, it creates a “first-come, first-served” system that alleviates the backlogs and allows green cards to be awarded more efficiently.Mike Lee, Republican”Immigrants should not be penalised due to their country of origin.”“Treating people fairly and equally is part of our founding creed and the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act reflects that belief. Immigration is often a contentious issue, but we should not delay progress in areas where there is bipartisan consensus just because we have differences in other areas,” Lee said.The bill has also been endorsed by Immigration Voice, Compete America Coalition, the Information Technology Industry Council, Google, Walmart, the US Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, The Heritage Foundation, La Raza, and many others.The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act alters the per-country limits for employment-based immigrants so that all are treated equally regardless of their country of birth.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>

And, it will finally remove the last vestiges of discrimination from our high-skilled immigration system,” Kapoor said."

345,"Reliance Blames ‘Illegal’ Actions By L&T Finance, Edelweiss For Stock Crash","New Delhi: The Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group on Friday accused L&amp;T and Edelweiss entities of “illegal” and “motivated” actions in invoking the pledged shares and selling them in open market, leading to steep declines in the share value of group firms.Both L&amp;T Finance and Edelweiss Group refuted the allegations by the Reliance Group.A few Non-Banking Finance Companies, “substantially L&amp;T Finance and certain entities of Edelweiss Group, have invoked pledge of listed shares of Reliance Group and made open market sales of the value of approximately Rs 400 crore from February 4 to 7,’ the group said in a statement.It was not clear who had pledged the shares.‘The illegal, motivated and wholly unjustified action by the above two groups has precipitated a fall of Rs 13,000 crore, an unprecedented nearly 55 per cent, in market capitalisation of Reliance Group over just these four short days,’ it noted.In that period, shares of Reliance Power plunged 62.1 per cent, while those of Reliance Infrastructure dropped 58.6 per cent, and Reliance Capital fell 38.6 per cent.The Reliance Group said the actions have caused substantial losses to 72 lakh institutional and retail shareholders, and harming the interests of all stakeholders.Citing legal advice, the group also said the purported exercise of rights to enforce the security is illegal and excessive, and against the process and requirements of the respective borrowings’ documentation.“The manner of conduct of the above open market sales… is also illegal on several counts, including amongst others, price manipulation, insider trading, front running and market abuse, and is in violation of various regulatory provisions…,” said the statement issued during market hours.Further, the group said that Reliance Capital, Reliance Infrastructure and Reliance Power as well as their various subsidiaries are performing satisfactorily on all operating parameters, and there is no change whatsoever on any aspect as compared to the position prevailing prior to these sales.Refuting the allegations, L&amp;T Finance said it had granted loans against pledge of shares to Reliance ADAG Group companies.“As per loan and pledge agreements, borrower did not cure various events of defaults including providing margin for shortfall in the stipulated security cover. “Despite various notices in the past few months, events of defaults continued. Consequently, L&amp;T Finance enforced its rights of invocation and sold pledged shares to the extent of its outstanding dues by following the due process of contract and law,” it said in a statement.While noting that the allegations as “unfounded, baseless and false”, Edelweiss Group said it had granted credit facilities against pledge of shares to Reliance ADAG Group.Edelweiss Group said it has reached out numerous times to Reliance ADAG Group to address concerns on shortfall in margins and resultant fall in collateral valuation.“Despite our best efforts, not only did Reliance ADAG Group fail to address any of the concerns raised by Edelweiss Group, but also continued to breach contractual obligations,” it said in a separate statement.On February 4, there was a sharp drop in the prices of Reliance ADAG group shares, which led to further erosion in the collateral value, Edelweiss said, adding that it also gave due opportunity for remediation. ‘Since there was no response from Reliance ADAG Group, it necessitated liquidation of the collateral as per the agreed contractual terms. Throughout this process, Edelweiss has acted in a lawful and responsible manner,’ it added.The group also said that plans by RCom to resolve its debt through the National Company Law Tribunal had no adverse impact on the three companies in question.RCom’s stock has dropped 55.2 per cent since it announced its plan."

Pakistan’s role in the peace negotiations is a delicate one, with Islamabad seeking to avoid demonstrating the kind of broad influence over the Taliban that Washington has long accused it of having. Sources caution its help could be temporary.The Taliban also do not want to appear beholden to Islamabad, which has long denied US accusations that it provides safe haven and assistance to insurgents as a way to preserve influence in neighbouring Afghanistan throughout its more than 17-year-old war.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly signalled his intention to wind down America’s longest conflict, declaring this week in his State of the Union address that “great nations do not fight endless wars.”<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 280px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: visible;""><iframe id=""aswift_3"" name=""aswift_3"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=2493370431&amp;adf=2315051888&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.9~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615635171&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Flong-a-spoiler-pakistan-begins-giving-behind-scenes-aid-to-us-taliban-peace-talks%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615635171009&amp;bpp=1&amp;bdt=1236&amp;idt=1&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D48c7f34d3e8bb0c2-228240c4dbc60051%3AT%3D1615635117%3ART%3D1615635117%3AS%3DALNI_Ma6XsDHxgUlFQib8e2Q-hJuJA_6Mg&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1034x280%2C699x280&amp;nras=4&amp;correlator=2298379506792&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=885501917.1615635115&amp;ga_sid=1615635170&amp;ga_hid=1326005856&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=9&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=1999&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=44737562%2C31060351&amp;oid=3&amp;pvsid=739210946608342&amp;pem=89&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=4&amp;uci=a!4&amp;btvi=2&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=CzSim5sYit&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=61"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!4"" data-google-query-id=""CLv3x4SWre8CFULoWwod4zUBnA"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
One senior US official, who declined to be identified, said of Pakistan’s role in the talks: “We know it just wouldn’t be possible without their support.” “They’ve facilitated some movement and travel to the discussions in Doha,” the official said.Trump’s administration has accelerated talks for a political settlement in Afghanistan. US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad held six days of talks – perhaps the most productive to date – with the Taliban in Doha last month and is due to meet Taliban representatives again on February 25.Speaking after Reuters reported the shift, Khalilzad confirmed at a forum in Washington that “there is a positive change in recent times” by Islamabad.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 0px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display: inline-table; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent;"" tabindex=""0"" title=""Advertisement"" aria-label=""Advertisement""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display: block; border: none; height: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; width: 699px; background-color: transparent; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0;""><iframe id=""aswift_4"" name=""aswift_4"" style=""left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0;width:699px;height:280px;"" sandbox=""allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"" width=""699"" height=""280"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-1320937060909444&amp;output=html&amp;h=280&amp;adk=2493370431&amp;adf=745272909&amp;pi=t.aa~a.3101776723~i.15~rp.4&amp;w=699&amp;fwrn=4&amp;fwrnh=100&amp;lmt=1615635171&amp;num_ads=1&amp;rafmt=1&amp;armr=3&amp;sem=mc&amp;pwprc=7021482993&amp;tp=site_kit&amp;psa=1&amp;ad_type=text_image&amp;format=699x280&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebmnews.com%2Flong-a-spoiler-pakistan-begins-giving-behind-scenes-aid-to-us-taliban-peace-talks%2F&amp;flash=0&amp;fwr=0&amp;pra=3&amp;rh=175&amp;rw=698&amp;rpe=1&amp;resp_fmts=3&amp;wgl=1&amp;fa=27&amp;dt=1615635171018&amp;bpp=2&amp;bdt=1244&amp;idt=2&amp;shv=r20210309&amp;cbv=r20190131&amp;ptt=9&amp;saldr=aa&amp;abxe=1&amp;cookie=ID%3D48c7f34d3e8bb0c2-228240c4dbc60051%3AT%3D1615635117%3ART%3D1615635117%3AS%3DALNI_Ma6XsDHxgUlFQib8e2Q-hJuJA_6Mg&amp;prev_fmts=0x0%2C1034x280%2C699x280%2C699x280%2C1017x586&amp;nras=6&amp;correlator=2298379506792&amp;frm=20&amp;pv=1&amp;ga_vid=885501917.1615635115&amp;ga_sid=1615635170&amp;ga_hid=1326005856&amp;ga_fc=0&amp;u_tz=345&amp;u_his=9&amp;u_java=0&amp;u_h=768&amp;u_w=1366&amp;u_ah=738&amp;u_aw=1366&amp;u_cd=24&amp;u_nplug=3&amp;u_nmime=4&amp;adx=31&amp;ady=2302&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=586&amp;scr_x=0&amp;scr_y=0&amp;eid=44737562%2C31060351&amp;oid=3&amp;psts=AGkb-H9I8Ts6njzeVLD5BucN3Iukur-ODu6SDENQb7CNMPtrYDtQXrW5UbVc8Aedea_dGvAVfdw2l9hgrCvr%2CAGkb-H-Hh6RujLBUyPtdhGQa3tkqz35BStPNMAlHNhBReLMWSy4vlSch0WnB4LEuMMeGorLQRr0dJ133KIjO&amp;pvsid=739210946608342&amp;pem=89&amp;rx=0&amp;eae=0&amp;fc=1408&amp;brdim=10%2C10%2C10%2C10%2C1366%2C0%2C1050%2C718%2C1034%2C586&amp;vis=1&amp;rsz=%7C%7Cs%7C&amp;abl=NS&amp;fu=8320&amp;bc=31&amp;ifi=5&amp;uci=a!5&amp;btvi=3&amp;fsb=1&amp;xpc=t6hOnYEl6Z&amp;p=https%3A//www.ebmnews.com&amp;dtd=830"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" vspace=""0"" hspace=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""true"" data-google-container-id=""a!5"" data-google-query-id=""CLmC94SWre8CFbUA-QAdKxAGbQ"" data-load-complete=""true""></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
“Pakistan has tried to facilitate talks between the Taliban and the United States and also favours inter-Afghan dialogue including between the Taliban and the (Afghan) government,” he said.Taliban sources said Pakistan’s role in bringing the Taliban to the negotiating table was instrumental. In one instance, Islamabad sent a message to the terrorists through religious leaders that they had to talk to the United States or risk a cut-off in ties.They detained Taliban members’ families as a way to pressure them, a Taliban leader told Reuters.“I haven’t seen Pakistan so serious before,” the senior Taliban leader said.The Taliban leader, who declined to be identified, said Pakistan had kept “unprecedented pressure” on the terrorists and their close relatives over the past few months. “They made it clear to us that we (Taliban) have to talk to the US and Afghan government,” the Taliban leader said.To be sure, current and former US officials still are highly sceptical of Islamabad and do not see any steps by Pakistan that could not be easily reversed.Washington appears for now to be sticking to a total freeze in US assistance to Islamabad imposed over a year ago over its suspected support to the Taliban. Trump at the time accused Islamabad of rewarding past US aid with “nothing but lies &amp; deceit.”<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_5_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_5_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
“There’s some self-interest obviously involved here … I would be wary of taking that and extrapolating off that and saying they’re now on board with the peace process,” said Jason Campbell, who was the Pentagon’s Afghanistan country director until last year and is now at the RAND Corporation think-tank.Afghanistan’s envoy to Washington, Roya Rahmani, said that any Pakistani shift in behaviour was still not apparent from Kabul, which has yet to participate in the talks. “For us, it still remains to be seen,” she told Reuters in an interview.PULLOUT PRESSUREPakistani sources suggest that the driver behind their country’s support for the talks is not US aid but growing concerns over the regional economic shockwaves that could follow an abrupt US pullout from Afghanistan.Those concerns have been strengthened by Trump’s surprise decision in December to withdraw completely from Syria, despite objections from the Pentagon.There are only about 14,000 US troops in Afghanistan, but their presence ensures a continuous flow of US financial assistance to Afghanistan.Islamabad, running short of foreign exchange reserves and in talks with the International Monetary Fund over what would be its 13th bailout since the 1980s, says it cannot afford to see Afghanistan slide into chaos just as Pakistan is trying to attract foreign investors to shore up its own economy.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_6_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_6_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
“That is our main worry in all of this,” said a senior official who is closely involved in cross-border relations.“We have enough economic issues of our own to deal with already.”One of the most notable public signs of Pakistan’s willingness to aid the negotiations was the release of Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.Now the newly appointed chief negotiator, Baradar is expected to fly from Pakistan to attend the next round of negotiations in Doha on Feb. 25.Dan Feldman, a former US special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said he believed Washington was still hesitant to become too hopeful about Pakistan’s change in posture. “There is cautious appreciation for the fact that Pakistan has seemingly done more than before to be helpful,” Feldman said, before adding that it did not “suggest a sea change in Pakistan’s position.”"
347,"Between 2014-2019, LK Advani Spoke Only 365 Words In The Lok Sabha","Analyzing Lok Sabha records of 2014-2019, India Today put together data which showed that LK Advani, co-founder of the Bharatiya Janata Party – has uttered only 365 words in the Lok Sabha in the past five years. This is despite the fact that Advani was present in Parliament on 92 percent of the days it was in session.This is an astonishing drop for the former Leader of Opposition who, on 8 August 2012 – had delivered a speech in the Lok Sabha which panned over nearly 5,000 words on the topic of an adjournment motion over the issue of illegal infiltration into Assam and large-scale ethnic violence in the state, the report added.However, almost seven years later, when the same topic was brought up in the Lower House, this time under the Narendra Modi government, which introduced the Citizenship Amendment Bill in the House on 8 January 2019 – Advani, didn’t utter a single word.According to the Lok Sabha records available on its site, Advani between 2009 and 2014, took part in 42 debates and proceedings in the Lok Sabha and uttered 35,926 words, India Today reported.Meet The Accidental Prime Minister’s LK Advani &amp; Lalu Prasad YadavComparing his verbal performance of 2009-2014 to that of 2014-2019, there has been a 99 percent drop in the same.Strangely enough, in the 16 Lok Sabha sessions held between 4 June 2014 and 8 January 2019, which panned up to a 321 days, Advani is ‘signed’ present on 296 days (92.21 percent), the report claimed.The records further indicate that all 365 words that Advani has spoken in the past five years in the Lok Sabha – were all uttered by him in 2014. In fact, he hasn’t spoken in the Lok Sabha since 19 December 2014.These 365 words were uttered by Advani over five different occasions in the Lok Sabha. Two of these occasions were the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker in the Lok Sabha, where he only said – “I support the motion”. This is striking, considering that in 2009, in his felicitation speech after the election of Mira Kumar as Lok Sabha Speaker, Advani uttered 440 words in one go, the report claimed.All About Aamir’s Screening of ‘Secret Superstar’ for LK AdvaniTwo other occasions where he spoke between 2014 and 2019, was when he had to present reports of parliamentary committees that was either under his charge or of which he was a member. In these occasions, he reportedly read out the name of the report he was presenting and said, “I submit the report on the floor of the House”.How Rahul Gandhi Took Down BJP in LK Advani’s PresenceThe fifth time he spoke in the House, was to comment on the migrant issue in Kashmir, where he referred to an older report by the parliamentary committee on the issue and advised for it to be revisited and to check whether its recommendations were still valid, the India Today report added."

“I am bringing an airboat from Australia that can land in water. Next time when I will come I will come in airboat. This airboat will operate from Varanasi to Allahabad. We also have plans to operate double-decker buses that can fly,” he said.Addressing Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, who was present on the dais, Gadkari said, “Maurya-ji you also start such air buses in Uttar Pradesh. It will solve your problem of traffic jam and this double-decker air buses are much cheaper than Metro.”The minister also said river ports are also being developed that will help in smooth movement of goods to Myanmar and Bangladesh.He claimed the department of River Development and Ganga Conservation has cleaned 30 per cent of the Ganga river and announced that by next March, the river will be 100 per cent clean and one can drink water from the river directly."

Most people give advice freely and no one takes any notice. Some follow professional advice because they’ve paid for it – but even then, it’s often said that if you don’t like your lawyer’s advice, change your lawyer.After an operation my British consultant surgeon advised me to drink in moderation. I asked him what “in moderation” meant and he said “less than your doctor!”.My grandfather used to say “Do everything, but do it in moderation.” I don’t think he’d thought it through. His “everything” surely didn’t extend to, for instance, sex with camels or moderate doses of heroin. His advice, if followed, might have led to certain degrees of contentment and a balanced existence – but then life’s temptations, as Adam found out. are more compelling than even God’s injunctions.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_3_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_3_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
I thought of old grandpappy (or Mamawaji as we called him in our Parsi household) when I read this week that Yoko Ono, the partner of the late John Lennon, had tweeted for some advice.Tweets, I believe, though not being a subscriber to the service I may be wrong, can only be addressed to the number of people who access them from a particular person, the person’s “followers”. In the case of people like Donald Trump or even Yoko Ono, however, their tweets get picked up by other social media and get a great deal of attention around the world.I was somewhat surprised by the fact of Yoko asking for advice, because I’d always thought of her as someone who dished it out freely, without a tinge of self-consciousness. Most of it is in the vein of “All You Need is Love” and other homilies and patently erroneous slogans, because apart from love I may need faith, hope, charity, sex and a good glass of Sauvignon Blanc.Kher! I am sure she means well.In this particular tweet she was asking her followers or the world to: “give us some advice that will make our lives heal and shine.”I think her “us” was short for all humanity and not just, in the royal fashion, a plural for “me”.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_4_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_4_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>

The veteran and sensible James O’Brien, a radio commentator whose radio programme I often follow, told us to put a bit of fizzy water in our Yorkshire pudding dough in order, I suppose, to guarantee that it will rise in the oven. I quote that particular culinary hint because I believe it will work for naan bread as well. A dash of fizzy water or even soda, yaaron!There were other handy tips for Londoners or visitors to London who were instructed on how to dodge circuitous journeys at a particular underground station by ignoring the directing signs and taking unmarked shortcuts.Sheesh! How time flies. I can’t say I encountered her, but I was in the same room long years ago when, as a young freelance writer, I stood outside the London Hilton hotel with hundreds of reporters, photographers and TV crews waiting for the Beatles to turn up and go in to meet Maharishi Mahesh Yogi who awaited them there.There was a heavy police cordon keeping us reptiles at bay as the Hilton had banned all journalists and crews. Or perhaps it was a request from the Beatles to have an unmolested darshan with their “spiritual guru”. The “reptiles” were restless and waiting for the Beatles’ limousine.My photographer partner at the time, Andrew Whittuck, said at least we can get snaps of them as they get out of their cars and you can write about the crowds. But, gentle reader, we struck it lucky.At the time I adopted the costume of the late 1960s and was in a khadi kurta over jeans, had long black hair and a beard and a worthless necklace of beads. George Harrison, a purported devotee of all things Indian, got out of his limousine and spotting me in the differently-clad reporter-crowd, grabbed my wrist and pulled me through the police cordon. I in turn had grabbed Andrew’s wrist and the cops made way for us as part of George’s entourage. He asked us if we wanted to report on the meeting, and consequently we were the only reporters there, standing behind Yoko and John who garlanded the maharishi and talked in unmemorable platitudes about peace and love.<div class=""google-auto-placed ap_container"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;""><ins data-ad-format=""auto"" class=""adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate"" data-ad-client=""ca-pub-1320937060909444"" data-adsbygoogle-status=""done"" style=""display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;""><ins id=""aswift_6_expand"" style=""display:inline-table;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""><ins id=""aswift_6_anchor"" style=""display:block;border:none;height:280px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:699px;background-color:transparent;""></ins></ins></ins></div>
Yes, I wrote it up that night and reaped from the British press the harvest of exclusivity.On reading Yoko’s request, I considered passing on my grandfather’s advice but thought better of it. It sounded too much like something she might say.My advice for Yoko would be to buy a good book on elementary English grammar and usage. When she says “give us advice that will make our lives heal and shine”, she is at best mixing metaphors and at worst, talking characteristic nonsense. Very well, she sees our lives as bodies with wounds or sicknesses and asks for ways of healing them. Then she asks in addition that the lives “shine”.I can see bodies shining after a good oil bath, but a life is each living thing’s particular stretch of time and the acts that go into it. What advice can lead to these abstracts taking on a quality of intense light?Yoko may mean that we should all work towards acquiring halos like angels. We shouldn’t steal other people’s husbands. We shouldn’t call our scribbles art or pretentious sounds music. And shouldn’t read anything that Californian life-style charlatans write, taking our money to make our lives “shine”."
350,The Irrationality Behind The Benchmark Price Of The Rafale Deal,"Of the several much-debated issues on the Rafale deal, one important aspect is the benchmarking of prices before negotiation. As widely reported and discussed in the media, the way the benchmark was fixed has been rather contentious.This issue, among others, has become the inflection point in the entire Rafale deal.What emerges from the media stories is that there was a difference of views among the Contract Negotiation Committee (CNC) members on the benchmark price worked out by the Adviser (Cost). While a few members went along with him on the benchmark price, others demurred. Thereafter it seems to have been put through a democratic process – a decision on the basis of majority views.The majority, so the story goes, didn’t agree to the benchmark price of €5.2 billion, as worked out by the Adviser (Cost), and instead suggested €8.2 billion.PMO Undermined Defence Ministry in Rafale NegotiationBut more materially, how could a majority view (4-3) overrule the minority view in the CNC, when the decisions are supposed to be collegiate? All over the entire DPP 2013, the term ‘collegiate’ has been used in ‘collegiate vetting’ or ‘collegiate manner’ or ‘collegiate discussions’. The term ‘collegiate’ emphasises ‘a work environment where responsibility and authority is shared equally by colleagues.’The difference in the two views expressed in the CNC seems to have arisen due to use of an ‘aligned cost table’ based on the 2007-RFP’s ‘non-deal’ to arrive at the higher benchmark price.It is here that paragraph 52 of DPP 2013 is relevant:‘ Cases for which contracts have earlier been signed and benchmark prices are available, the CNC [contract negotiation committee] would arrive at the reasonable price, taking into consideration the escalation/ foreign exchange variation factor.’Since there were no signed contracts on the item and thus no benchmark price was available, it’s baffling how the benchmark price was revised upwardly, by use of this intriguing ‘aligned cost table’. The ‘aligned cost table’ used by the majority view in the CNC was based on the benchmarking of the 2007-RFP non-deal that wasn’t relevant, and thus had no foundation. Not to reiterate that this higher benchmarked price of €8.2 billion flew on the face of express provisions of the DPP 2013.If there were differences of opinion on benchmarking among members of the CNC, with three crucial members – joint secretary and acquisition manager, finance manager, and advisor (cost) who had the relevant domain expertise on benchmarking – plumping for €5.2 billion, while others sought enhancement to €8.2 billion on an ‘aligned cost table’, the details doubtless deserve a close look-in to see if there were any irrationalities and illogicalities.If what has been put out in public space is correct, it is evident that the majority view on benchmark price was that of, what I may say, the so-called lightweights in the CNC, while the minority view was that of the domain experts.A quick look at the profile of each CNC member vis-à-vis their expertise will bear this out.To start with, one member (JS, DOMW) on the majority side, had no role whatsoever to play on fixation of benchmark price. His nomination was contingent on inclusion of the offset proposal, and his role strictly confined to the offset issue. Nor does he have any expertise on benchmark price.Another member, JS &amp; Additional Financial Adviser, too had no direct role to play in the benchmark price fixation. His job profile in the MoD concerns overseeing financial matters pertaining to revenue procurements and he is an outsider to the CNC on matters of defence capital procurement. Also, not being a permanent member of the CNC as spelt out in DPP 2013 but a member nominated in this case by the RM, he can’t be deemed as a core member so far as benchmark price fixation goes.The National Security Advisor Had No Locus Standi to Negotiate the Rafale ContractThe same goes for the other two members, the Deputy Chief of Air Staff (DCAS) chairing the CNC, and the Assistant Chief of Air Staff (Plans) who, as per procedure, is nominated as the member-secretary of CNC by the Chairman (DCAS): their core competence lies elsewhere, not on working out the nitty-gritty of the benchmark price.On the other hand, the crucial man is the Adviser (Cost) [a JS-level officer from the Indian Cost Accounts Service (ICoAS)] who works out the cost-sheets of various items based on his domain expertise and who attends the CNC as and when required, specifically to perform such mandates. He is helped along by the Finance Manager (Air) – another JS-level officer – who is the whole time finance expert meant only for defence capital acquisition and is acquainted with the cost elements.The third and crucial member is the JS &amp; Acquisition Manager (Air) who anchors all defence capital acquisitions and is familiar with all capital procurements/costing of various items.This is not to forget the aspects of ToT and licensed production cost, plus the cost of setting up the facility in India in the so-called non-deal of RFP-2007 that will likely pan out post the RFI (Request for Information) of April 2018. To take into account this amount and to amortise the cost per unit and then to work out the figure for 36 Rafale in fly-away condition and arrive at the ‘aligned cost table’ can hardly be considered rational. The logic is flawed because it is invalid.To elaborate, going by the RFP-2007 this expenditure was to be amortised over the entire spectrum of 1o8 aircrafts to be manufactured in India and the 18 Rafale aircrafts in fly-away condition from France.‘The costs of the aircraft would include direct acquisition including that of weapons and missiles, warranty for first two years, licence royalty for manufacture in India, cost of technology transfer and costs of initial training.’Beyond this issue of amortisation, it’s well to remember that even the depreciated value of the facility set up in India, upon closure of this production line, too has a residual value (not a small sum), and needs to be costed.Amortisation in its classical sense is applied to intangible assets. When funds are invested for setting up a facility that is quantity-neutral, it is natural that the greater the number the better it gets for the investor. With the cost of such investment deemed inexorable, the higher the number the lesser the cost per unit with the investment spread across a wider spectrum, thus pulling down the unit price.How logical is it then to apportion this expenditure over 36 units instead of a much higher number as envisaged in the RFP-2007 ‘non-deal’? Clearly this can’t be viewed as a prudent and reasonable benchmark price to buy from public funds. It’s much too simplistic a calculation to convince even the gullible and the uninitiated.Éric Trappier, head of Dassault Aviation, at the Le Bourget airshow near Paris in 2015. Credit: DassaultOften in the public slugfest, another crucial issue that segues and flows out of the present buy has been missed out. It is critical, because beyond the 36 Rafale aircraft it will inevitably raise many gnawing questions for future buys. For one, will this Rafale deal not impact on future benchmark price determination of fighter jets among different vendors that includes Dassault Aviation?Will, then, Dassault not willy-nilly get a head start over other vendors in overall assessment/evaluation of future fighter aircraft RFP(s)? How contractually ‘correct’ and moral will that be? Will it not endow on Dassault a witless advantage vis-à-vis other competing firms, especially on India specific enhancements (ISE) (or by any other technical specifications these are spelt out in the Request for Proposal (RFP)) that lately have been much in the news and are said to be the vital elements in pushing up the cost of the Rafale deal beyond the cost of bare-bone aircraft?High Transfer of Technology Costs Made UPA’s Rafale Deal Much Cheaper than NDA’sThrow in the new variable of strategic partners and ‘Indian Production Agency’ already indicated in the RFI, and you get a sense of the besetting issue staring at us.Given this backdrop – using the ‘aligned cost table’ – to arrive at benchmarked price and the resultant advantage embedded for Dassault in the form of setting-up of ISE developmental facility for benchmarking in the Rafale case, it boggles one’s mind how a levelled field could be worked out and offered to all vendors for MMRCA or fighter jets as in the April 2018 RFI. It is hard to think of a levelled field that could be on offer in the imminent future to all vendors without putting Dassault at an unevenly high advantageous perch.Does it, then, follow that the seeds of disparity have already been sown, albeit unwittingly, and shall stay the course regardless, as long as similar technical specifications hold? It is hard to second-guess on so convoluted an issue.Notwithstanding all that has been said, it doubtless couldn’t be much of an ask to let the citizens know on what grounds the benchmark price proposed by CNC’s domain experts was overruled.The justifications adduced to negate and overrule the benchmark price are vital – on it hinges one of the most important aspects of the whole Rafale polemics.If the logic to overrule is overpowering and convincing, it would smother all doubts and give the present brouhaha a quiet burial. Shouldn’t the government then not be transparent on this aspect instead of taking refuge under the secrecy agreement?"
351,Zee Telugu Announces World Television Premiere Of Sumanth Starrer Subramanyapuram,"Hyderabad: Zee Telugu announces the World Television premier of Subramanyapuram starring Sumanth (Karthick) and Esha Rebba (Priya) in the lead roles. The film will be telecast on Sunday, 10th February, at 6pm.Produced by B.Sudhakar Reddy, Subramanyapuram is titled after the name of the village Subramanyapuram where the news of a series of people committing suicidesurfaces at the sight of a peacock and the village is made to believe that it is due to the curse of the local deity. Karthick (Sumanth) is an atheist whose profession involves researching on old temples and monuments. Unlike the rest of the village Karthick refuses to believe in the reason and decides to unveil the truth behind this mystery after he faces a personal loss himself. He falls in love with Priya (Esha Rebba) who is the only connection between him and the village. He takes up the challenge with the people of the village to find the person responsible behind the series of death in 10 days.Caught between the belief of villagers and facts about the mysterious deaths surrounding the temple, the film beautifully captures how Karthick decodes the secretive element in the story and seeks to find the truth."
352,I Want To Be Part Of The Industry At All Times: Ankit Siwach,"Ankit Siwach, he of the shy smile and arresting looks, is the latest heart-throb in TV-land to have grabbed the swooning admiration of the fairer sex. Young girls and women of all ages just can’t get enough of him. His turn as Ram in television’s chartbuster show, Manmohini, has been widely appreciated and earned him an entire legion of female fans.In a free-wheeling chat with IWMBuzz, Ankit shares his take on playing Ram, and lots more. Read on..You had been away for a long time after Chakravyuh. What kept you busy?After Chakravyuh, I was seen in Ishqbaaaz. Then the episodic for Laal Ishq with Prateek happened. I was working on a travel show that I hosted and produced. I was off to Ladakh for this for a month. It was a very good phase after Chakravyuh, as I also did a short film ‘Khidki’ and the web-series Dulha Wanted. It is great to have bagged the lead role in Manmohini. I am enjoying this enriching experience.Moving to Manmohini, it is a different genre for you? What prompted you to pick it up?When I met Prateek Sharma and he started narrating the story of Manmohini to me, I did not blink for minutes together. The story was so engaging that I was so engrossed listening to it. So I never got to think whether I wanted to be part of a supernatural. Chakravyuh was more towards reality and it was shot in a different way. When Prateek offered me the role in Manmohini, I simply grabbed it as this is a big show for the team and channel. We have so far got a great response. Our hard work will continue so that we give the best product to the audience.You look more handsome as a today’s man. Why get into a genre that requires you to go royal in getup?Thank you for your compliment. What I believe is that changing to a royal look makes a person look good in a different way. Wearing those ornaments gives me a new feel altogether. It is coming out nicely, thanks to the creative team and the costume team.What have been the challenges in playing Ram?The biggest challenge in playing Ram is that sometimes I do not relate to the situation because I don’t see any witches playing around me. So when you don’t relate to it, you don’t know how to react to such situations. So for me this aspect has been the biggest challenge.What do you think is the best part about the character?The best part of playing Ram is that he is also the soul of the previous birth when he was Rana Sa. So even though the guy is same, he is playing two different souls. Whenever Mohini takes over, he becomes Rana Sa and when he is Ram, he is Ram. So the best part is to play two characters in one role.We hear the team shot in rather extreme conditions in the desert area before the launch?There was a scenario where a production guy was bitten by a scorpion in the desert. I believe the desert is not a normal terrain to work. It was pretty tough for all of us. Temperatures were soaring. But I think we did a good job.You had a few tiring schedules outdoor before launch. Could you take us through that?Yes, the outdoor shoot for Manmohini was pretty exciting. We shot at Jaipur, Jodhpur and Jaisalmer. Temperatures were very high and I was suffering from dengue. But the energy level of the whole team was so high that the shoot went on very smoothly. We were able to get some really good scenes shot there. We used to wake up at 3 in the morning and shoot till 11 or 12 in the night. We also shot for 24 hours at a stretch on few occasions. All of it was a great experience for me and to all of us. We are now proud of being able to pull it off. The episodes shot outdoors looked really good and got appreciated.Did you have to work on your dialect for the show?Yes, I had to work on my dialect, as Ram, who has returned from abroad, has the normal dialect. But as he turns to Rana Sa, he has to get a touch of Rajasthani. It was not very difficult for me because Daima and Mohini speak in Rajasthani all the time. So working with them and doing scenes with them gave me an idea of how to go with it. And all this helped me get the dialect right.How is it to be with two beautiful girls – Garima and Reyhna in the show?Garima and Reyhna are very good to work with. All the scenes that I do with them come out really well. We share a great bond on the set. We usually have lunch together. There are positive energies coming from both of them. It is Garima’s first show, but she has been doing a tremendous job. Both of them are brilliant. I feel lucky to get this show with them.Tell us about what viewers can expect as of now?The story line right now has a lot for the viewers. Sia is wounded badly and Ram is doing all that it takes to save her. He wants his Sia back as of now. So whatever methods he is trying to get his wife back are being shot right now. All of this should excite the audience as there will be great twists and turns.How do you actors gel on the set?All in the cast sit together and chat. We laugh throughout the day. Though the shoot gets tedious, we never feel the pressure. We always try to keep the ambience on the set fresh and interesting.How is it to work with Prateek Sharma?I have worked for Prateek in Laal Ishq as well. So we got to know each other over there for the first time. We sat together and spoke about things. Probably the wavelengths matched and soon he wanted me to audition for the lead role in his Zee TV show. He is a genius and if we go by his track record, he has a great writing sense and a very good production sense. At such a young age, he has achieved so much. So God bless him with lots of success.What is your take on TRP as an actor? How much does it matter to you?TRP is of importance because no matter if you make good shows, or you have given a great scene, or you have given everything you have, but still you don’t get TRPs. The world is very tough. They will not take time to chop off scenes and take the show off. So I think what counts in the end is TRP. Until the audience watches the show and we get a good feedback with respect to TRP, the top level people are not happy with it, and it becomes impossible to sustain. The better TRPs we get, the better we shoot and the longer we run.Would you be game to work on the web platform?I surely want to do a good web-series, with a good story, a different character, probably more towards realism. I enjoyed the process when I was part of Dulha Wanted. Though it was a small part, it was a very crucial role and I loved it.Tell us about the hardships you faced for a particular scene for Manmohini?I will not call them hardships but yes, situations have been very difficult. They have been hard at times because of weather, health conditions or the timings of shoot. There were days when we shot for 3-4 days without sleep. So yes, these were the challenges we had to fight and overcome. I think all of us as a team have been doing it well by God’s grace. Hopefully we will continue to strive hard in the same manner.How has the viewers’ response been?Thankfully, audience has been showering their love and blessings. We have been getting a very good response. We opened well (2.1) and have been able to sustain good levels of TRPs. We have not continued a single track for a long time. That is keeping audience engaged.As a person how much does success matter to you?I don’t know how to define success. I don’t know how to count it or measure it. I feel if I am working and I am happy while working, and if my family is happy and people who care for me are happy, I think that should be success. So yes, if I enjoy whatever I am doing, I am successful. That’s my definition of being successful.What are your set goals in life?I have been shifting fields for quite sometime now. I took up science, and then arts and later got into commerce. I wanted to join the airforce, and wanted to get into business as well. Then I shifted to modeling. But all of this has been a learning process. Nothing goes waste. I don’t plan much and think much. I am looking forward to doing good work as an actor. I want to improve myself. I want to understand the industry, and understand the process of show making. I want to be part of the industry all the time.What does happiness mean to you?Happiness to me is watching my family smile and be proud of me. They have gone through a lot because of me. They have sacrificed a lot, but have supported me. I owe a lot to them. So if they are happy, I am cent percent happy."

354,Valencia Salvage Away Draw With Betis In Copa Del Rey Tie,"Valencia fell behind 0-2 to Real Betis in the first leg of their Copa del Rey semi-final tie before rallying for a 2-2 draw.Roughly 700 Valencia supporters were among the more than 57,000 people in the stands at Sevilla’s Benito Villamarin stadium on Thursday for the contest between the two evenly matched opponents separated by just 2 points in La Liga, reports Efe news.Betis suffered a setback in the 10th minute when defender Marc Bartra, who failed to finish last weekend’s La Liga match against Atletico Madrid due to injury, found himself unable to continue.The departure of Bartra, who was replaced by Javi Garcia, seemed to create a greater opening in the midfield for Valencia and the visiting side threatened on successive occasions approaching the half-hour mark. But Betis keeper Joel Robles proved equal to the challenge, thwarting Rodrigo Moreno and Santi Mina, and the first goal of the night belonged to the hosts.In the final minute of the first-half regulation time, Sidnei da Silva flicked on a Sergio Canales cross to Loren Moron, who headed in to put Betis up 1-0.Joaquin Sanchez doubled the advantage for Betis nine minutes into the second half with a so-called Olympic goal: a corner kick that enters the net without any intervening touch.Chief official Carlos del Cerro Grande confirmed the goal after consulting with the video assistant referee (VAR), which seemed to amplify the negative impact on Valencia’s collective psyche.As the match entered the final 30 minutes with Betis in hot pursuit of a third goal, Valencia coach Marcelino Garcia Toral went for a double substitution: Geoffrey Kongdobia for Francis Coquelin in midfield and Kevin Gameiro for Mina up front.The Valencia reaction began to take shape in the 70th minute with a goal by Denis Cheryshev that energized the squad.The Russian had a chance to bring his team level minutes later, but his header bounced off the post, and it was left to Gameiro to secure the draw with a goal in stoppage time.The 2-2 deadlock in Seville follows Wednesday’s 1-1 draw between Barcelona and Real Madrid in the other semi final first leg, generating plenty of suspense ahead of the respective second legs on February 27-28.Among the final four, Barça – going for a fifth consecutive title – have won the Copa del Rey 30 times, while Real Madrid have hoisted the trophy 19 times.Betis are two-time winners, most recently in 2005, and Valencia have seven Copa del Rey championships to their credit."
355,"Test Cricket Is Dying, Says ICC Chairman","Dhaka, International Cricket Council (ICC) chairman Shashank Manohar says the Test Cricket is dying because people no longer have time to watch the longest format of the game. Mr Manohar, who arrived in Dhaka on Wednesday at the invitation of Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Nazmul Hassan, said on Thursday that the ICC Test Championship, starting in July this year, was one of the last-ditch efforts to revive the Test Cricket. “We are trying to see whether Test Championship can generate interest,” ESPNcricinfo quoted Shashank Manohar as saying. “Because Test Cricket is actually dying to be honest. So to improve the situation, we are trying ways and means. The [ICC] board directors came to a conclusion that if we start a Test Championship, it would keep Test Cricket alive and generate more interest in the game.”"

357,Women’S IPL 2019: T20 Event To Become Three-Team Affair,"New Delhi: From one exhibition match last year, the women’s participation in the IPL is set to become a three-team affair spread over seven to 10 days with the Committee of Administrators (CoA) mulling an expansion this year.However, the full-fledged women’s IPL is still a long shot as, according to an official, the BCCI is finding it extremely difficult to get good investors/team bidders.Last year, the BCCI organised one exhibition match with two teams — IPL Trailblazers and IPL Supernovas led by Mithali Raj and Harmanpreet Kaur respectively.This year, the parent body, currently run by the Supreme Court-appointed two-member CoA, wants to scale it up a bit in order to set the ball rolling for a women’s IPL in a few years’ time.“Yes, the women’s T20 matches will be held this year also. It will be a week to 10 days affair during the men’s IPL. Once the BCCI gets clearance from the election commission and Home Ministry on dates, the itinerary will be fixed,” a senior board functionary told PTI on conditions of anonymity.However, the official said it would be difficult to have more than three teams considering the “quality” of India’s bench strength in women’s cricket.“At the max, we can have three teams with Harmanpreet, Smriti and maybe Mithali (for this year) leading the sides. They play against each other once and the top two play a tournament decider. It could be a seven-day affair,” the official said.“BCCI would decide the teams as there aren’t any proper bidders who are interested in buying women’s teams. Yes, we might rope in a few good sponsors,” he said.“So at the moment, the BCCI will have to pay the players, including the match fees of foreign players, along with a decent prize money,” he added.Even if it’s a three-team affair with 14 players aside, the BCCI will need at least 30 Indian women who could measure up for a top-flight league cricket.The problem that BCCI faces, according to insiders, is that a sub-standard A team has failed to become a supply line for the main team.“Kindly check when most of the senior team girls have made their debuts and how many new performers we have got save Jemimah Rodrigues. Recently an India A team lost by 300 plus runs against Australia which tells you the story about our second string,” the official said.The other factor will be convincing Star Sports to broadcast the event or at least live stream it.There is a school of thought that women’s matches should be held at second-tier centres to get good crowds but during the IPL, to have another set of crew managing a women’s event may turn out to be a massive logistical task.So it will either be a 4 match before the men’s game or a 7 pm match a day before the men’s game at one of the IPL venues."
358,Ponting Appointed Assistant Coach Of Oz Cricket Team,"Melbourne: Former captain Ricky Ponting has been appointed as an assistant coach of Australia’s men’s team for the 50-over World Cup in England later this year, Cricket Australia said, Friday.The 44-year-old Ponting will work with Australia’s batsmen for the May 30-July 14 tournament, with current batting coach Graeme Hick focussing on preparing the side for the Ashes tour in England, starting in August.Ponting’s appointment is the second major shakeup in Australia’s backroom staff in as many days, with bowling coach David Saker resigning ‘effective immediately’ on Thursday. Saker has been replaced temporarily by Troy Cooley.Australia won their fifth World Cup title on home soil four years ago and head coach Justin Langer said that Ponting’s experience in leading the team to two of those victories would be invaluable in England.“Ricky knows what’s required to win World Cups, and I know he will be a valuable mentor to not just the batting group, but the broader squad as we focus our attention on defending our World Cup title,” Langer said.“Ricky and I have worked together with the Australian men’s team in the past, he is an extremely driven coach who is fully invested in the players development and improving Australian cricket. He has an impressive understanding of the game,” added Langer.Ponting played 375 ODIs for Australia and led them to the World Cup titles in 2003 and 2007. He was also a member of Steve Waugh’s winning side in 1999 – the last time the tournament was played in England.Ponting has had short-term engagements with the Australian men’s limited overs team in recent years and will begin his role after Australia’s one-day series against India and Pakistan.“I’ve enjoyed my previous short-term roles with the ODI and T20 teams but World Cups take on a whole different meaning for me,” Ponting said.“I have enormous confidence in the players available to the selectors and know we will be as tough to beat as any team, in this year’s World Cup,” added the former Australian skipper.Reuters"
359,"Parallel Negotiations For Anil Ambani, Proves ‘Chowkidaar’ Is A Thief: Rahul","New Delhi: Congress president Rahul Gandhi stepped up his attack on the Narendra Modi government over Rafale deal in a press conference in New Delhi on Friday following The Hindu news report alleging that the defence ministry protested ‘parallel parleys’ by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) with the French authorities.Rahul said the news report ‘makes it crystal clear that the Prime Minister was conducting parallel negotiations’ with the French government on Rafale deal.‘We have been saying this for more than a year that the Prime Minister is directly involved in the Rafale scam…It is absolutely black and white that the Prime Minister himself was carrying a parallel negotiation with the French,’ Rahul said.He added that PM himself robbed Air Force’s Rs 30,000 crore and gave it to Anil Ambani.“Who do you think he’s doing parallel negotiations for? Not for you and me? It is for Anil Ambani… this proves that Chowkidaar is a thief,” said Rahul.Continuing his attack on PM Modi. Rahul said that the entire Supreme Court judgement on the Rafale deal has now become questionable as the information was withheld by the government.A report published by The Hindu said that ‘the French side took advantage of parallel parleys by the PMO and the Defence Ministry with the French government that weakened Indian team’s position’ during negotiations on Rafale deal.Congress chief Rahul Gandhi on Friday said he has no problem if the government investigates his brother-in-law Robert Vadra or senior party leader P Chidambaram as long as it also answers questions on the Rafale jet deal.“Whatever inquiry you want to do, you do it. You implement the law. Robert Vadra, P Chidambaram – you implement the law on everyone. No problem. But you also give answers on the Rafale matter,” he said at a press conference.Vadra was questioned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for nine hours on Thursday, the second day of his deposition in connection with a probe into allegations of money laundering to purchase assets abroad.Karti Chidambaram, son of former finance minister P Chidambaram, was also questioned for about six hours by the ED on Thursday in connection with a money laundering probe against him in the INX Media case.“You do whatever inquiry against Mr. Chidambaram you want. He will face any inquiry. You do inquiry on anybody you want…But please explain to us why the defence ministry is saying that prime minister has carried out parallel negotiations,” Gandhi said. Describing Rafale as an “open and shut” case, he said, “I am telling you that whatever investigation you want to do, you should do it. You are the one who is in government. But then investigate this (Rafale) too.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday strongly defended the Rafale deal during his reply to the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s address in the Lok Sabha.‘I am levelling a serious allegation. I want to say it on the floor of Parliament that the Indian National Congress doesn’t want our armed forces to be strong… You want the Rafale deal to be cancelled. On whose behest? For which company?,’ PM Modi said, attacking the Congress."
